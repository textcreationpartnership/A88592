            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:122181:4"/>as they were taken from the mouth of the reverend Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, whoſe endeavour it was to pierce the conſcience, rather then to pleaſe the eare; A gariſh dreſſe is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>befitting a chaſte Matrone; if thou expect here what may be pleaſing to a wanton appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, ſtay at the threſhold, thou wilt loſe thy labour; if thy ſtomach be for wholeſome Food, and Doctrine accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Godlineſſe, enter in, this diet is for hungry ſoules. The firſt part will ſhew thee how thou muſt proceed to
<pb facs="tcp:122181:4"/>obtaine, and aſſure thy heart of pardon of ſin, <hi>viz.</hi> by a ſound Confeſſion; this duty is much decried in theſe dayes of Libertiniſme, but by ſuch as decry the power of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, and are loath to have a check put upon their licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe; but doe thou remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber he that hideth his ſin ſhall not proſper, hee that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth, and forſaketh it, ſhall finde mercy: If we ſay wee have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves, and make God a lier; if we confeſſe our ſinnes, he is faithfull and juſt to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
<pb facs="tcp:122181:5"/>them; pardon of ſinne is the purchaſe of the bloud of Chriſt, but intailed upon the Confeſſion of ſinne. The latter will ſhew thee thy great advantage by Chriſts aſcenſion, interceſſion, and returne to judgement; this is a ſubject moſt ſutable for the laſt times, times of perill, and temptation, to quiet, comfort, and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, to keepe the heart in the love of God, in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient waiting for Chriſt, and unſpotted in the world: We have much talke in the
<pb facs="tcp:122181:5"/>World that Chriſts perſon ſhal reigne for <hi>1000.</hi> yeares up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth: hee that can ſee this in Scripture, hath a clearer ſight then I; but what ever becomes of this opinion, we are ſure of and ſtay our ſoules upon this, That our bleſſed Saviour is now at the right hand of God in glory, pleading the cauſe of his deſpiſed ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, waiting till his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies be made his footſtoole, from whence we expect him at that great day to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme our vile bodies into
<pb facs="tcp:122181:6"/>the ſimilitude of his glorious body, to take us into theſe manſions prepared for us, that we may ſee his glory, and be for ever with the Lord. Theſe meditations if they were often in our mindes, would engage us to be ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, unmoveable, alwayes abounding in the work of the Lord, becauſe our labour is not in vain in the Lord.</p>
            <p>One thing more I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſe thee, that in the peruſing of theſe little Treatiſes thou wilt meet

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Pſalme treats of the bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a juſtified, of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned ſinner, touching which, ſeverall particulars are hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.

<note place="margin">Pſal. 85 2</note> 
               <hi>Thou haſt forgiven the iniquity of thy people, Thou haſt covered all their ſinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is ſinne in us to hide our ſinnes, as
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:122181:10"/>it is ſinne to hide our talents, ſo it is ſinne to hide our ſinne; therefore when the Pſalmiſt ſaith the forgiveneſſe of ſinne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the covering of ſinne, this covering by God is underſtood.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This forgiveneſſe is ſet out <hi>by not imputing of ſinne,</hi> verſ. 2. Sinne ſhall not be imputed unto a juſtified perſon, though ſtill it ſhall be inherent in him.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, Here is laid down the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a pardoned man, nothing hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his happineſſe: verſ. 3. <hi>When I kept ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, my bones waxed old, through my roaring all the day long:</hi> yet for all this <hi>David</hi> cals him bleſſed, though Gods hand was heavie upon him, yet his heart was ſtill towards him, yet a bleſſed man, though an afflicted man.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, Here is laid down the courſe that the Pſalmiſt took to procure par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſinne, that is in my Text, <hi>I ſaid, I will confeſſe my tranſgreſſions to the Lord, and thou forgaveſt the iniquity of my ſinne.</hi> Thus I have brought you by the hand to the Text. I ſhall give you a ſhort paraphraſe of the words: <hi>I ſaid,</hi> this word implies in Scripture phraſe three things: Firſt, it notes a deliberation or conſideration of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:122181:10"/>the minde, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14. verſ. 1.
<note place="margin">Pſal. 14.1.</note> 
               <hi>The fool hath ſaid in his heart, there is no God:</hi> (that is) he hath thought ſo in his minde,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 30.6</note> that there is no God. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30. verſ. 6. <hi>And in my proſperity I ſaid, I ſhall never be moved:</hi> that is, I thought ſo. Saying, is not alwayes an act of the tongne, but ſometimes of the minde: <hi>I ſaid I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe my ſinne,</hi> that is, I have bethought my ſelf, and conſidered in my minde, that it is meet for me to get pardon and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe my ſinne to God. <hi>I ſaid,</hi> It notes ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly the purpoſe and the reſolution of the will; ſo you have it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. verſ 57.
<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.57.</note> 
               <hi>Thou art my portion O Lord, I have ſaid, that I would keep thy words.</hi> There ſaying, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to be purpoſing or reſolving of the will.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>I ſaid,</hi> it implies the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or practiſe of what the minde reſolves upon, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39 verſ. 1.
<note place="margin">Pſal. 39.1.</note> 
               <hi>I ſaid I will take heed to my wayes, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am put upon the practiſe of taking care unto my ſteps and to my wayes: the meaning of the phraſe is this, I ſaid I will confeſſe my tranſgreſſion, I have bethought it ſo in my minde, that it is good and meet ſo to do, I have purpoſed and reſolved in my will and am actually put on the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of it, <hi>I ſaid I will confeſſe my tranſgreſſion.</hi> It is worth your notice, that ſinne is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt by three words in this Text; firſt,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:122181:11"/>
               <hi>tranſgreſſion,</hi> ſecondly, <hi>iniquity,</hi> and thirdly, <hi>ſinne;</hi> I <hi>will confeſſe my tranſgreſſion, and thou forgaveſt the iniquity of my ſinne.</hi> There are but four places in the Scripture wherein theſe three words are joyned together in one verſe, <hi>Tranſgreſſion, Iniquity,</hi> and <hi>Sinne. Exod.</hi> 34.
<note place="margin">Exod. 34.7.</note> verſ. 7. <hi>Keeping mercy for thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, forgiving iniquity, tranſgreſſion, and ſinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Micah</hi> 7.
<note place="margin">Mic. 7.18.</note> verſ. 18. <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and paſſeth by the tranſgreſſion of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, becauſe he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth in mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Levit.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Levit. 16.21.</note> 16. verſ. 21. <hi>And</hi> Aaron <hi>ſhall lay both his hands upon the head of the live Goat, and confeſſe over him all the iniquities of the children of Iſrael, and all their tranſgreſſions in all their ſinnes, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is likewiſe uſed in <hi>Job</hi> 13.
<note place="margin">Job 13.23.</note> verſ. 23. <hi>How many are mine iniquities and ſinnes, make me to know my tranſgreſſion and my ſinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In theſe four places the words are uſed in Scripture and in my Text, but not elſe as: I remember throughout the word of God: and becauſe theſe three words are here uſed; Interpreters take much pains to finde out ſome material direction between them: here is <hi>Tranſgreſſion, Sinne,</hi> and <hi>Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity;</hi> I have conſulted with many, and the trueſt account I can give you is
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:122181:11"/>this; <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Tranſgreſſion</hi> ſignifies in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Rebellion, ſay interpreters, it notes ſinne with all extenſions and aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, ſin encreaſed to a great height. Scondly, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Sin</hi> ſignifies in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> evils that are of the leſſer degree; that are not ſo hainous, and ſo notes only by ſin evils of infirmity and common incurſion. Thirdly, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Iniquity</hi> ſignifies ſin of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that pravity of nature wherein a man was born. But <hi>Grammarians</hi> in the <hi>Latine</hi> do diſtinguiſh theſe words otherwiſe, <hi>Iniquity,</hi> they make to be that which is done againſt <hi>another man: Sinne,</hi> that which is done againſt <hi>a mans ſelf:</hi> and <hi>Tranſgreſſion,</hi> that which is done immediately againſt <hi>God.</hi> But beloved, the Scripture in many places, makes them all one. Therefore we need not make further curious enquiry after the diſtinction of theſe words, <hi>And thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaveſt the iniquity of my ſinne. The iniquity of my ſinne;</hi> There is ſome diſagreement about the ſenſe of theſe words, what it is for God to forgive the iniquity of ſin: By the iniquity of ſin, ſome do underſtand the puniſhment that ſin deſerves: the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that ſignifies <hi>Iniquity,</hi> ſignifies <hi>Puniſhment;</hi> the ſame word here is ſpoken of <hi>Cain, My puniſhment is greater then I can bear,</hi> there is the ſame word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in ſome tranſlations it is read thus, <hi>Thou forgaveſt the puniſhment of my ſinne.</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:122181:12"/>Secondly, others here do underſtand by the <hi>iniquity of ſin,</hi> (with whom I do concurre) ſin with all its aggravations, with all its hainous circumſtances, ſin with all its ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity, <hi>Thou doſt forgive the iniquity of all my ſins:</hi> moſt Interpreters go this way, and ſo make the phraſe to be very emphaticall, <hi>Thou hast forgiven me my ſin;</hi> that is, all hainous circumſtances that might greaten my ſin, <hi>thou haſt forgiven them all.</hi> I ſhall only make a ſhort entrance at this time into the firſt part of my Text, <hi>I ſaid I will confeſſe my tranſgreſſion to the Lord:</hi> Theſe words contain in them a holy purpoſe in the Pſalmiſt to ſet on the practiſe of a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and Chriſtian duty, to wit, ſecret confeſſion of ſin to God? in them five parts paets are obſervable. Firſt, the duty it ſelf, <hi>Confeſſion.</hi> Secondly, a deliberate purpoſe to ſet on the practiſe of this duty, <hi>I ſaid.</hi> Thirdly, the ſubiect matter of this duty, <hi>Tranſgreſſion,</hi> and Tranſgreſſion with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, <hi>my Tranſgreſſion,</hi> not of other mens ſins but my ſins, <hi>I ſaid I will confeſſe my tranſgreſſions.</hi> I remember <hi>Ainſworth</hi> he ſaith it ſhould be tranſlated thus more agreeable to the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>I will confeſſe</hi> adverſum me <hi>againſt my ſelf my tranſgreſſion to the Lord.</hi> Many men that confeſſe ſin, but they do confeſſe ſin as againſt God, that is, they do confeſſe ſin as if God were the author of ſin, that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:122181:12"/>charge him to be the patron of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety and of their wickedneſſe, <hi>I ſaid I will confeſſe my tranſgreſſions againſt my ſelf.</hi> Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The object of this duty, <hi>I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe my tranſgreſſion to the Lord:</hi> and this beloved takes off Auricular confeſſion, uſed and ſtood on much in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Confeſſion that God cals for, and the Scripture cals for, is in ſecret between God and your own ſouls; when conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhall ſuggeſt guilt to you in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to your former miſdoings, when you can pour out your ſoul in complaint to God, <hi>I ſaid, I will confeſſe my tranſgreſſion unto the Lord.</hi> Fifthly and laſtly, The iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue and event of this duty, <hi>and thou forga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt the iniquity of my ſin:</hi> obſerve the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion, here is a connective particle, <hi>and</hi> thou forgaveſt: he doth not come with an <hi>Ergo</hi> or a <hi>Quare,</hi> not with a cauſall, but with an <hi>et,</hi> a copulative, <hi>and</hi> thou forgaveſt; not I confeſſe ſin, <hi>therefore</hi> I am forgiven; but I confeſſe ſin, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>and</hi> thou haſt forgiven me. Forgiveneſſe of ſin is not laid down as an effect flowing from a cauſe, but as a conſequent flowing from an antecedent; indeed the Papiſts plead much for merit, becauſe ſometimes cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall particles are uſed, but this is beyond my Text: thus much for the explaining of the words. At this time I ſhall only raiſe a Doctrine from the firſt part of this
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:122181:13"/>Text. <hi>I ſaid, I will confeſſe my tranſgreſſion unto the Lord.</hi> 
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
               </label> The point of Doctrine is this: That juſtified perſons who have their ſins forgiven,
are yet bound to confeſſe ſin to God.</p>
            <p>And here the confeſſion I ſpeak of, is a private confeſſion of our evils to God, between God and our own ſouls, and no otherwiſe: and beloved, though it be but a familiar ſubject; yet as God ſhall inable me, I ſhall labour to make it uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and profitable for your edification in a Chriſtian courſe, in a holy confeſſion of ſin before your God.</p>
            <p>There are many Queres to be diſpatcht in the handling of this point.</p>
            <p>The firſt Quere is, What are the reaſons why perſons juſtified and pardoned, are yet bound to make confeſſion of ſinne unto God in private? The Reaſons are ſix.</p>

As wind when it is diſperſt and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed through the air doth little hurt; but when it is concealed in the bowels of the earth, it makes ruptures and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, overthrows things up and down: Sin when it is unconfeſt, concealed, and

Now you know vomiting doth give eaſe to a burdened ſtomach, when the ſtomach is pained and burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and oppreſt. A man is ſick at the heart when meat doth not digeſt, the vomiting of the load off of the ſtomach doth eaſe the ſtomach: ſo ſaith <hi>Origen,</hi> That when the conſcience is burdened, when a mans ſpirit is troubled, pouring out of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and confeſſion to God doth eaſe the minde: A ſinner is like a veſſel of new wine filled and ſtopt up cloſe, till it hath vent it is ready to burſt; ſo is a godly man filled with ſinne, till he can vent by confeſſion to God, ready to burſt.

Thus the ſervants of God uſed to do, when they confeſt ſin unto God, they would confeſſe ſin with all the hainous circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances: 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.47. <hi>Saying, We have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and have done perverſly, we have committed wickedneſſe.</hi> Saith <hi>Lorinus,</hi> Mark what a heap of words a heart-humbled ſoul will lay together in confeſſing of ſin; <hi>We have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> there is one word; <hi>we have done wickedly,</hi> there is a ſecond; <hi>and we have done perverſly,</hi> there is a third.

<note place="margin">Act 26.10.11.</note> 
               <hi>Which thing I alſo did in Jeruſalem, and many of the ſaints did I ſhut up in priſon, having received authority from the chief prieſts; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice againſt them.

            <p>The fourth Quere is this, Wherein ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears the difference of a godly mans ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king confeſſion of ſin unto God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe confeſſions of ſin in wicked men: and there are theſe eight diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, Holy confeſſion in godly men, makes the ſoul to be more active and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive after cure, remedy, and pardon for ſin: holy confeſſion makes the ſoul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious. I confeſſe ſin, but how ſhall I ſubdue ſin? I acknowledge ſin; but how ſhall I get pardon for ſin? It makes it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire how to get cure and remedy for the evils which before were confeſt.
<note place="margin">Job 7.20.</note> 
               <hi>Job</hi> 7.20. <hi>I have ſinned, What ſhall I do unto thee, O thou preſerver of men? &amp;c.

            <p>

            <p>The wicked confeſſe ſin, but they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver grieve for the ſins they have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they are not aſhamed, neither can they bluſh, in the Prophets language.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, A godly man in confeſſion of ſin, hath more freedome of ſpirit to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe his particular ſins in ſecret, then he hath in publique: <hi>I have poured out my ſoul before God,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt: confeſſion of ſin is a pouring out the ſoul before God; he that can pour forth complaints againſt ſin in ſecret more then in publique, is a gracious man.</p>
            <p>The wicked are only for confeſſion of ſin before men, and not before God.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. Fourthly, Godly men confeſſe ſin freely, out of a willingneſs they have to be rid of ſin: wicked men confeſſe ſin, with confeſſions extorted and drawn from them as men on a rack whether they will or no. Godly men confeſſe ſin freely, they
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:122181:25"/>are freely willing to part with their luſts, therefore they confeſſe them to God,
<note place="margin">Job 32.18, 19, 20.</note> 
               <hi>Job</hi> 32, 18. <hi>For I am full of matter, the ſpirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me conſtraineth me.</hi> Verſ. 19. <hi>Behold my bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is as wine which hath no vent, it is ready to burſt like new bottles.</hi> Verſ. 20. <hi>I will ſpeak that I may be refreſhed, I will open my lips, and anſwer.</hi> Thus a godly man in confeſſing ſin his belly is as it were burſt with new wine, he muſt needs have vent, elſe he is broken, he muſt needs confeſſe ſin, his ſin drives him to God. But confeſſion is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted and wreſted from wicked men. It was the plagues of Egypt upon <hi>Pharaoh</hi> that wrung confeſſion from him: before theſe he would ſay, <hi>Who is the Lord?</hi> It was pangs and horrour of conſcience in <hi>Judas,</hi> that forced him to acknowledge he had ſinned in betraying innocent bloud. Mariners caſt over their goods, not that they hate them, but as they are forc't to doe it to eſcape drowning; when there is a ſtorm and a tempeſt in their conſciences, then men are forc't to confeſſe ſin, it is by compulſion, it is not voluntary.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, A godly man is conſcious to confeſſe ſecret and ſmall ſins, as well as groſſe wickedneſſe. <hi>David</hi> confeſt his pride and carnal confidence in numbring the people, as well as his adultery with <hi>Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheba: David</hi> confeſt the cutting off the lap of <hi>Sauls</hi> garment, as well as ſpilling
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:122181:25"/>the bloud of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah.</hi> But hypocrites con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe their groſſe ſins, but not their ſmall ſins. <hi>Cain</hi> confeſt his murder, but not his envie, <hi>Cain</hi> confeſt his murder, but not his bad offering: they confeſſe their groſſe ſins but not their ſmaller. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt his oppreſſion of the children of Iſrael, but he did not confeſſe the ſecret hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his heart. But godly men though they have not ſo many groſſe and open evils, yet ſmall and ſecret evils pinch their conſciences, and troubles their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Thoſe evils which will not break a wicked mans ſleep, will break their hearts: what though they have not uncleanneſſe in the fleſh? what though they have eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the pollutions of the world? yet they know they have ſecret and inward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filements on the ſpirit: and theſe they bewaile, &amp; theſe they acknowledg to God.</p>
            <p>A ſixt difference is this, that godly men are diſtinct and clear to confeſſe theſe particular ſpeciall evils that have moſt predominancy over them. Beloved, obſerve this; Wicked men in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions are confuſed, and only run in generall that they are ſinners; Juſt like <hi>Ahimaaz</hi> when he would bring tidings to <hi>David,</hi> touching the iſſue of the battell with <hi>Joab</hi> and <hi>Abſalom,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I ſaw a tumult, and I heard a noyſe, but I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> Wicked men will tell you that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:122181:26"/>their ſins do make a noyſe within them, but they can tell you nothing diſtinctly, and nothing particularly, but only go at randome. Wicked men in confeſſing ſin are like <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,
<note place="margin">Dan. 2.</note> Dan.</hi> 2. <hi>He dreamt ſomething but he could not tell what it was:</hi> Wicked men dream of ſins and think of them as confuſedly as a man in a dream; but when, how, and where, and with what aggravating circumſtances they know not: they have not a diſtinct and clear view of their corruptions. Thus <hi>Bellarmine</hi> did ſhew his wickedneſſe in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he was not wicked, when he was on his death-bed; and his Confeſſor came to him to have him confeſſe his ſin to him, ſaith <hi>Bellarmine, I do not know any ſin in my ſelf to confeſſe.</hi> This was not the holineſſe of the man, but heedleſneſſe that he did not obſerve his wayes. <hi>Donatus</hi> the great ringleader of the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> ſaith, <hi>O Lord I have nothing that thou ſhouldst pardon me.</hi> Beloved, this doth ariſe from ſtupidity that men ſee not ſin; it doth not ariſe from holineſſe, but from heedleſneſſe and careleſneſſe. It is an obſervation that one hath on <hi>Job,</hi> ſaith <hi>Job, I have ſinned, and cauſe me know mine iniquity, and my tranſgreſſion and my ſin.</hi> Whileſt <hi>Job</hi> made this complaint that he had finned, God ſaith, <hi>in all this</hi> Job <hi>ſinned not:</hi> that is, not abſolutely, but meaning comparative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:122181:26"/>Beloved, to be free in complaints, and to be full in confeſſion of ſins, doth not argue that you have more ſin then other men have; but it argues that you have more ſight then other men have, and the leſſe ſinne you have in you.</p>
            <p>

            <pb n="38" facs="tcp:122181:28"/>
            <p>Firſt, Confeſſion of ſin to God hath been practiſed by all the godly under the Old Teſtament; and therefore why ſhould it not be uſed under the New?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. He made a prayer to God, and it conſiſted of 16. verſes, and 14. of them verſes were ſpent in confeſſing of ſin.</p>
            <p>And thus the godly in <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s dayes made a prayer to God, and the whole prayer conſiſted of 32. verſes, and 31. of them verſes were ſpent in confeſſion of ſin. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayſt hear the prayer of thy ſervant, which I pray before thee now day and night, for the children of Iſrael thy ſervants, and confeſſe the ſins of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael, which we have ſinned againſt thee, both I and my fathers houſe have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.10. <hi>And</hi> Davids <hi>heart ſmote him, after that he had numbred the people: and</hi> David <hi>ſaid unto the Lord, I have ſinned greatly in that I have done: and now, I beſeech thee, O Lord, take away the iniquity of thy ſervant, for I have done very fooliſhly.</hi> That is one thing to confute this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Not only Beleevers under the Old Teſtament, but alſo Converts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the New Teſtament, did make conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of confeſſing of ſin unto God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.6. <hi>And were baptized of him in Jordan, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:122181:28"/>their ſins. Act.</hi> 19.18. <hi>And many that beleeved came, and confeſſed, and ſhewed their deeds. Luk.</hi> 15.17. <hi>And when he cameto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he ſaid, How many hired ſervants of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have bread enough, and to ſpare, and I periſh with hunger?</hi> Verſ. 18. <hi>I will ariſe, and goe to my father, and will ſay unto him, Father I have ſinned againſt heaven, and before thee.</hi> It is an embleme of a Convert, if ſo be it be a parable: In the inſtance of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican, that Chriſt declares was juſtified ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the Phariſee, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.13. <hi>And the Publican ſtanding afar off, would not lift up ſo much as his eyes to heaven, but ſmote upon his breſt, ſaying, God be mercifull to me a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> verſ. 14. <hi>I tell you, this man went down to his houſe juſtified rather then the other, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now beloved when you have inſtances in the Old Teſtament, and many exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in the New, why then ſhould we blot out ſo uſefull a part of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip as this, of confeſſion to God in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, God doth command confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſin unto him. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Goe and proclaime theſe words towards the North, and ſay, Return thou back-ſliding Iſrael, ſaith the Lord, and I will not cauſe mine anger to fall upon you, for I am mereifull, ſaith the Lord, and I will not keep anger forever. Onely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge thine iniquity, that thou haſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed againſt the Lord thy God, &amp;c.</hi>

            <pb n="40" facs="tcp:122181:29"/>
            <p>Fourthly, God, both in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and in the New, hath annexed many gracious promiſes to a ſincere confeſſion of ſin unto him: in the Old Teſtament, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.40. <hi>If they ſhall confeſſe their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their treſpaſſe which they treſpaſſed againſt me, and that alſo they have walked contrary unto me,</hi> Verſ. 41. <hi>And that I alſo have walked con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary unto them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies: if then their uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed hearts be humbled, &amp;c they then accept of the puniſhment of their iniquity, Then will I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber my Covenant with</hi> Jacob, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If they <hi>confeſſe their iniquity,</hi> I will <hi>remember</hi> them. <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.13. <hi>He that covereth his ſins ſhall not proſper, but whoſo confeſſeth and forſaketh them ſhall have mercy. Job</hi> 33.27. <hi>He look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon men, and if any ſay, I have ſinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not, &amp;c.</hi> And in the New Teſtament, in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9. <hi>If we confeſſe our ſins, he is faithfull and juſt to forgive us our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſſe.</hi> Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved put all theſe four together; the godly have practiſed this under the Old Teſtament, Converts under the New, God hath commanded it, and he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſed it; therefore thoſe that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count confeſſion of ſin to be but a legall and ſervile work deſerve reproof.</p>
            <p>A ſecond reproof, is to thoſe of the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:122181:29"/>Popiſh Religion, who in ſtead of ſecret confeſſion of ſin to God in prayer, doe preſſe vehemently Auricular confeſſion in the ear of the Prieſt. Touching this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricular confeſſion, they ſpend many vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes for to make good the divine right of it; the Councell of Trent do lay an <hi>Anathema</hi> on any that ſhall not count Auricular confeſſion to be neceſſary to ſalvation. There are theſe ſeverall miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes and errors in the Popiſh Doctrine of Auricular confeſſion.</p>
            <p>Firſt, They urge the neceſſity of it, that you muſt not expect ſalvation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Confeſſion againſt whom, againſt what you did it, all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of your ſins you muſt acknowledge to the Prieſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That the Prieſt upon your confeſſion, hath power from Chriſt to give you pardon, to give you abſolution; theſe goe currant with them about Auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular confeſſion.</p>
            <p>That you might ſee this is blame-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and worthy of reproof; I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute it by theſe Conſiderations.</p>
            <p>Firſt Conſideration of the time when Auricular confeſſion came firſt in uſe in the Church: Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtorians tell us that for 800. years after Chriſt there was no ſuch practiſe in the Church of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:122181:30"/>God: And that the Law of Auricular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion was not enacted untill Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third, which was about 1200 years after Chriſt: and the firſt Councell that did eſtabliſh Auricular confeſſion, was the <hi>Laterane</hi> Councell; and after that, the Councell of <hi>Trent.</hi> The Church of God in the Primitive times having no ſuch practiſe, it may be exploded from being now in the Church of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Why did the Popes invent Auricular confeſſion? One doth demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate this;</p>
            <p>Firſt there is this reaſon: It is a notable invention to diſcover the ſecrets of mens thoughts both in Church and State.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is a means to get money for the Pope: for according as the ſin confeſſed, is more capital and notorious; ſo the more money muſt be given for indulgence and pardon; thus a reverent Divine cals it, the picklock of Sacramentall confeſſion: this being enacted meerly out of State policy to know mens ſecret thoughts and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; and likewiſe to bring in profit and revenues to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> which doth ſhew the practiſe to be unjuſtifiable.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Conſider what the Scripture doth preſſe concerning confeſſion unto men, mark the text, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Confeſſe your faults one to another, and pray one for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:122181:30"/>that ye may be healed.</hi> The Scripture doth not tye us to a Prieſt as the Popiſh Religion ties them: but it tyes us, that in anguiſh of conſcience and trouble of minde we confeſſe to any who are able to give us wholeſome counſell from the Lord.</p>
            <p>A good note our Proteſtant Interpreters have againſt the Papiſts: the Apoſtle bids, <hi>if a man be ſick call for the Elders of the Church,</hi> and they were to pray for him; but he doth not bid them confeſſe ſin to the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, but confeſſe ſin one to another; which doth no way tye to confeſſe ſin to a Prieſt. But this is a point of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, and bleſſed be God this Church not tainted with this errour; therefore I ſhall leave it: this is the ſecond ſort that is to be reproved; to wit, thoſe of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Religion, who in ſtead of confeſſion of ſin unto God, bring in Auricular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to the Prieſt.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sort </seg>3</label> Thirdly, This Doctrine reproves thoſe who to avoid the Popiſh Auricular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to the Prieſt, deny all kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of ſin unto men: there are many faulty, many who keep the devils coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, who groan under ſtrong corruptions; yet will never open their mindes to have counſell and prayer from other men. There are ſome peculiar and ſelect caſes wherein we are not only bound to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:122181:31"/>fin unto God, but to confeſſe ſin unto men: but before I handle this, take theſe two Cautions.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Caut. </seg>1</label> Firſt Caution is this, That you are not to confeſſe ſin needleſly to men, but when there is a great and an urgent neceſſity, when you are exceedingly troubled in conſcience, and cannot be comforted; in ſuch a caſe you may go to men to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge what ſins trouble your conſciences: but to confeſſe ſin needleſly to men, you are not called. God doth not love, ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> that we ſhould goe to men to reveal our ſhame, but go to God; unleſſe the caſe be very urgent, that by all the means ye can uſe, ye cannot eaſe your ſelves, then are ye to confeſſe to men in that caſe.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Caut. </seg>2</label> Secondly, That when ye are to confeſſe ſin to men, you are not to confeſſe ſin to every one; you are to confeſſe ſin to thoſe that are compaſſionate, that are of ability to pray for you, to thoſe who have wiſdome and can counſell you, to thoſe who have pity that can compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate you, to thoſe who have experience that can adviſe you, to thoſe that can give counſell, and keep counſell: you are not to confeſſe your faults to any but to thoſe you think are tender hearted, to be able to pray for you. Beloved if a man ſhould be indiſcreet and laviſh in confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:122181:31"/>and confeſſe his ſin to every body, it may be ſome would jear and reproach him: <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> in his Homilie on <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> hath this expreſſion, If thou confeſſe thy ſin in ſome mens ears, they will caſt thy ſins in thy face in a way of ſcorn: ſome men would deal with you as the Phariſees did with <hi>Judas; Judas</hi> when he was ſmitten in conſcience for ſin, came to the Phariſees and ſaid to them, <hi>Here is your money again, for I have ſinned in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying innocent bloud:</hi> ſay they, What is that to us? look you to it, for what you have done: ſo, men will expreſſe no pity, and will give no counſell: therefore there muſt be wiſdome in revealing of your ſins to other men. Thus you have the Cautions preſcribed unto you.</p>
            <p>Now in what Caſes is it meet that men ſhould confeſſe their ſins to men as well as unto God? I ſhall reſolve this to you in four Caſes.</p>

               <hi>Euſebius</hi> relates, that <hi>John</hi> the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt riding a journey, was met by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of theeves; amongſt whom was a young man their Captain, whom <hi>John</hi> did convert, and the ſtory ſaith, that this young man now converted by <hi>Johns</hi> wholſome counſell, went to all his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low theeves, and adviſed them in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, that they would not walk in that way of wickedneſſe; he was troubled in conſcience, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore gave them earneſt counſell, that as they loved their ſouls, they would not walk in that way of wickedneſſe; and by that means many of theſe great robbers became great Converts. In like manner do ye to thoſe that know of your drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe, of your adultery, &amp;c. confeſſe your ſins, as <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> ſaid to the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, I am not the ſame man I was: and it may be, that ſo their conſciences may be awakened, and they ſtartled for it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think themſelves of their wicked courſes, and God may work a change in them, as he hath done in you.</p>
            <p>There is one uſe more of this point, and that is for lamentation; to humble you in the preſence of God, that ſeeing God cals you to confeſſe ſin to him, you have ſo many palpable and manifeſt defects in ſecret confeſſing of your ſins to God.</p>

            <p>Now beloved, there are ten uſuall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Defects </seg>10</label> to which not only the wicked but the godly are lyable in their confeſſion of their ſins unto God.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Defect </seg>1</label> The firſt Defect in confeſſion of ſin unto God is this, that when men come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe ſin to God, they have ſuch a barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and confuſion on their ſpirits, that they cannot call to remembrance their particular ſins to confeſſe them. <hi>Hilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham</hi> hath a good note deſcanting on them words in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.8. <hi>If we ſay that we have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves, and the truth is not in us.</hi> Saith he, If we ſay that we have no ſin, there is no man ſo groſſe to ſay that he hath no ſin, for his own practiſe will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye his tongue: but it is when we come to God, we do as in effect ſay ſo, when we do not know what ſin to confeſſe to God; we are ſo confuſed, and heedleſſe in obſerving our own wayes, that we do not know what to confeſſe in prayer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and that the Apoſtle condemns.</p>
            <p>This was the fault of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> when his Confeſſor came unto him, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> did proteſt unto him, that he did not know one ſin that he was guilty of to confeſſe unto the Prieſt: this was heedleſneſſe in him, for if he had obſerved his own wayes, he would have found ſins enough to have confeſt: many are heedleſſe that they doe not take notice of their own evils. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:122181:35"/>this is a common and an ordinary Defect; there are many when they come to prayer though they have manifold ſins in them, yet they are ſo confuſed, ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinct in the knowledge of their own wayes, that they have only generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, Lord we have ſinned, Lord we have done evill in thy ſight, but cannot call to mind any particular ſin they have done; Was it never thus with you, that ye did not know what to bewail to God, and what to lament of in his preſence? this is a Defect that godly men are often plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Defect </seg>2</label> A ſecond Defect in the confeſſion of ſin to God is this, when men in prayer do confeſſe many ſins to God, yet do leave out their maſter and predominant ſins: many men are large in confeſſion, yet do leave out their maſter ſins. <hi>Moſes,</hi> though a good man, yet was faulty in this regard; God commanded him to go to <hi>Egypt</hi> to deliver his people, but ſaith <hi>Moſes, I am not eloquent, I am of a ſlow ſpeech;</hi> he did complain of a naturall defect, but he did not complain of a ſpirituall defect, but God did anſwer all his pleas in <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.19. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto</hi> Moſes <hi>in</hi> Midian, <hi>Go, return into Egypt: for all the men are dead which ſought thy life.</hi> Verſ. 20. <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>took his wife, and his ſons, and ſet them upon an aſſe, and he returned to the land of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:122181:35"/>Egypt.</hi> So that here God put his finger upon the ſore: <hi>Moſes</hi> complained of the peoples incredulity, of his own naturall infirmity, but <hi>Moſes</hi> did not complain of his ſlaviſh fear, that if he ſhould go to Egypt there were men that would kill him; till God did aſſure <hi>Moſes</hi> that thoſe men that ſought to kill him were dead, <hi>Moſes</hi> would not goe: here a good man would not confeſſe his ſlaviſh fear, that he did fear death; therefore he would not goe on Gods command. Beloved, this is a Defect that doth many times cleave to godly men to leave out their predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſins and to confeſſe ſins but of an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary incuſſion.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Defect </seg>3</label> A third Defect in confeſſion of ſin to God is this, to have the heart to hanker after the committing of thoſe ſins you do confeſſe. <hi>Auſtin</hi> doth ingenuouſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge this of himſelf, ſaith he, I did often beg ſtrength of God againſt the ſin of incontinency, yet had often an unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe in my heart that God ſhould hear my prayers, leſt I ſhould leave my ſins.

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Defect </seg>4</label> A fourth Defect in confeſſion of ſin to God is this, to confeſſe to God the ſins
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:122181:36"/>of your life, but not the ſins of your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: many men will be large in confeſſing the ſins of their life, but ſeldome or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bewail the ſins of nature, that vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous inclination in the heart to ſin; very few but <hi>David</hi> in the Old Teſtament, and <hi>Paul</hi> in the New, who did ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe originall ſin, <hi>David</hi> in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. there he begins to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail the root of thoſe ſins which he was guilty of. So <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. bewails the body of ſin: many men bewail actuall ſin, but not habituall ſin, but not originall ſin: many men bewail bad actions, but never confeſſe unto God their vicious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination. This Defect good men many times are guilty of.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Defect </seg>5</label> A fifth Defect is this, to confeſſe groſſe and open ſins, but not to confeſſe ſmall and ſecret evils: we are commanded to keep the Law as the apple of our eye, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.2. <hi>Keep my Commandements and live, and my Law as the apple of thine eye.</hi> Now you know, a man that keeps his eye will not only keep his eye from great blowes, but will keep it from ſmall motes, which may put out the eye as well as a great blow; men ſhould not only take heed of great blowes, great tranſgreſſions, but they ſhould take heed of leſſer motes, ſmall ſins. Now beloved, good men many times commit thoſe ſins that are infamous,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:122181:36"/>that the naturall light of conſcience can controll them for, why thoſe evils are complained of, and confeſt; but ſecret evils, wandring thoughts in duties, vanity of minde, the deadneſſe of the heart, empty of ſpirituall meditations, inward diſtruſt; theſe evils are ſeldome bewailed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt: this is many times a Defect found in good men, good men are not ſo apt to confeſſe omiſſion of good, as commiſſion of evill.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Defect </seg>6</label> A ſixt Defect in confeſſion of ſin to God is this, to confeſſe ſin more becauſe of its guilt, then of its ſpot: my meaning is, more becauſe ſin hath a damning power, then a defiling nature; more becauſe ſin damns thy ſoul, then defiles thy conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. A child would touch a coal though it be ſmutty and ſoily, but he forbears to touch it meerly becauſe it is a burning coal: we forbear ſin becauſe ſin is a burning coal, but we do not forbear to touch it becauſe it is a defiling coal: that is a Defect in many godly men to be found.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Defect </seg>7</label> A ſeventh Defect in confeſſion of ſin to God is this, to confeſſe thoſe ſins to God, which if men ſhould charge us with, we ſhould deny and be angry. This holy <hi>Greenham</hi> doth take notice of in mens confeſſion of ſin; thou wilt confeſſe thy pride to God: but if a man ſhould ſay

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Defect </seg>8</label> The eighth Defect in confeſſion of ſin unto God is this, not to have the heart ſenſibly affected with thoſe ſins that are confeſſed to God; many confeſſe as if they were telling ſtories rather what other men did, then what themſelves did: there are few that confeſſe ſin as the prodigal did, that he was aſhamed to be called the ſon of his father. But many confeſſe ſin like <hi>Pharaoh, Exod.</hi> 9.27. <hi>And</hi> Pharaoh <hi>ſent and called for</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Aaron, <hi>and ſaid unto them, I have ſinned this time, the Lord is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and I and my people are wicked.</hi> Verſ. 34. <hi>And when</hi> Pharaoh <hi>ſaw that the rain and the hail and the thunder were ceaſed, he ſinned yet more, and hardned his heart, he and his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</hi>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Defect </seg>9</label> The ninth Defect in confeſſion of ſin to God is this, to content your ſelves with ſlight, ordinary, and generall confeſſion of ſins, to come into Gods preſence and a ſay you are ſinners; this is a fault which Chriſtians many times are guilty of, many men reſt contented with a confuſed and a generall confeſſion of ſin when they doe not come to any diſtinct view of their
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:122181:37"/>particular ſins, there is a tumult in the conſcience; ſome noyſe they make in a prayer, but they know nothing diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but like <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> in a dream, he knew he dreamt, but he forgot what his dream was: many men do confeſſe ſin, but they know not what they do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe.

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Def. </seg>10</label> A tenth Defect in confeſſion of ſin to God is this, that they are bold and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturous to commit the ſin again which they have confeſt: they confeſſe paſſion, and afterward are bold and adventurous to run into a rage and fury. When a man ſhall confeſſe on his knees he hath done thus and thus, and hath been thus and thus, yet afterwards all the impreſſions of theſe confeſſions are defaced, and he is bold to adventure on the commiſſion of the ſin again; This is alſo a Defect that may be found amongſt good men in their confeſſion of ſin unto God.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, Call to remembrance ſome old tranſgreſſion of many years paſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy converſion, and muſter up theſe ſins together, that ſo thou mighteſt have matter of complaint and confeſſion before God. Suppoſe preſent guilt doth not come up before thee; then recollect and review old tranſgreſſions, ſins of an old date; this <hi>David</hi> did when he found his heart dull and ſluggiſh, he would call to mind the ſins of his youth,, Pſalm 19. When you ſee that your hearts grow barren of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall matter through heedleſneſſe, goe then and ranſack your old wayes, what did you 20 years agoe, let conſcience gawle you for that, that ſo you may have matter enough to confeſſe unto God. This rule doth not appertain to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans under trouble of conſcience but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to thoſe Chriſtians that are ſluggiſh and barren of any ſpirituall complaints and confeſſions in Gods preſence.</p>
            <p>A word of Uſe further for direction.</p>
            <p>If it be ſo, that Juſtified perſons are bound to make ſecret confeſſions unto God: then,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Chriſtians keep a heedfulneſſe over your hearts, that you may not let ſin go unconfeſt; make conſcience and be heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that ſin committed by you may not
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:122181:39"/>be unconfeſt: a ſin unconfeſt as to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion may be unpardoned; a ſin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confeſt cannot be mourned for, cannot be actually repented of. Obſerve, that a leſſe ſin unrepented of, may damn a man, when a greater ſin that is confeſt to God may be pardoned: if you compare <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David</hi> together, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.9. <hi>But</hi> Saul <hi>and the people ſpared</hi> Agag, <hi>and the beſt of the ſheep and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and of the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly deſtroy them: but every thing that was vile, and refuſe, that they deſtroyed utterly. Saul</hi> did there commit a farre leſſe ſin then <hi>Davids</hi> was, to wit, adultery, <hi>Saul</hi> did only for his private uſe ſpare the fatteſt of his ſheep and oxen, it was little or nothing in compariſon of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> ſin, yet behold <hi>David</hi> was pardoned and <hi>Saul</hi> damned, <hi>David</hi> had his ſin par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned and <hi>Saul</hi> not; why? <hi>David</hi> did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe ſin, and <hi>Saul</hi> not: <hi>Saul</hi> did delude the reproof of <hi>Samuel,</hi> and told him the people did it, and not I; <hi>Sauls</hi> ſin uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt ruined him: therefore take heed of letting ſin go unconfeſt, a leſſe ſin uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt may damn a man, when a greater ſinne that is confeſt may not damne him.</p>
            <p>A ſecond Direction is this, Depend not upon the moſt in larged and the moſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible confeſſions that ever you have made
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:122181:40"/>to God, ſuppoſe thou haſt poured out thy ſoul to God, thou art never the better: thou O man when thou doeſt confeſſe ſin, thou doeſt but like a begger ſhew God thy ſores, thy botches, and ſcabs, do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon your confeſſions; as you muſt not depend on your righteouſneſſe, ſo not upon confeſſion of your ſinfulneſſe. It is worth your obſervation, <hi>Saul</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing <hi>David</hi> like a Partridge over the mountains, <hi>David</hi> cut off the lap of his garment; ſaith <hi>David, well, I have ſinned;</hi> and Saul, <hi>thou art more righteous then I:</hi> when <hi>Nathan</hi> came to <hi>David, David</hi> ſaid, <hi>I have ſinned,</hi> and <hi>Nathan</hi> told him, <hi>the Lord hath taken away thy iniquity: Saul</hi> ſaid, <hi>I have ſinned,</hi> yet the Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> told him, <hi>the Lord hath taken away thy Kingdome:</hi> here is not the ſame reſult, for <hi>David</hi> had his ſinne taken away, and <hi>Saul</hi> had his Kingdome taken away, therefore do not depend on your confeſſions.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Take this Direction, that when you confeſſe ſin to God and are the moſt vile in your own eyes, you are then moſt amiable in Gods eye: <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Look not upon me becauſe I am black, becauſe the ſun hath looked upon me.</hi> The Church there confeſt to Chriſt I am black and not comly, ſhe was ſun-burnt as ſhe thought. I, but in verſ. 8. <hi>My Love, my Dove, thou art the faireſt among women:</hi> Chriſt lookt on
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:122181:40"/>her as the faireſt among women: ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.14. <hi>O my Dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the ſecret places of the ſtaires: let me ſee thy countenance, let me hear thy voyce; for ſweet is thy voyce, and thy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance is comely.</hi> When the poor Dove the Church lay in a hole under the ſtairs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing and mourning like a Dove for her ſinfulneſſe, <hi>O</hi> ſaith Chriſt to her, <hi>let me ſee thy face, and let me hear thy voyce.</hi> Chriſt doth love to hear the moan-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings of his people, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.18. <hi>I have ſurely heard</hi> Ephraim, <hi>bemoaning himſelf thus, Thou haſt chaſtiſed me, and I was chaſtiſed, as a bullock unaccuſtomed to the yoke: turn thou me, and I ſhall be turned; thou art the Lord my God.</hi> It is worth your notice, <hi>Job</hi> when he was afflicted by God in having botches and boyles all over his body, it is ſaid, <hi>Job</hi> made his complaint to God, chap. 7. verſ. 20. <hi>I have ſinned, what ſhall I doe unto thee, O thou preſerver of men?</hi> I have ſinned ſaith <hi>Job,</hi> but what doth God ſay of <hi>Job?</hi> in all this <hi>Job</hi> ſinned not, <hi>Job</hi> 1.22. <hi>In all this</hi> Job <hi>ſinned not, nor charged God foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly.</hi> It was not ſpoken abſolutely he ſinned not, but the meaning is he ſinned not ſo as other men ſinned. The more you bewaile, condole, and confeſſe ſin to God, and are by reaſon thereof vile in your own eyes, the more amiable you are in Gods eyes. And thus I have done
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:122181:41"/>with the firſt part of the Text, <hi>I ſaid I will confeſſe my tranſgreſſion unto the Lord.</hi>

            <p>Firſt, The manner of bringing in this Act of God, the Pſalmiſt doth not bring it in thus, with an <hi>Ergo, I ſaid I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe my tranſgreſſion to the Lord, therefore he forgave the iniquity of my ſin,</hi> but it is with an <hi>et,</hi> a conjunctive particle, and not a cauſall, <hi>I confeſſe,</hi>

            <p>Secondly, Obſerve this further, the manner of the expreſſion, the <hi>confeſſion</hi> was in purpoſe and intention, but the <hi>forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> is actuall: obſerve from hence this note, That God doth recompenſe the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gracious purpoſes as well as perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances of his own ſervants; God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave, but <hi>David</hi> did but purpoſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe; <hi>I ſaid I will confeſſe, and thou forgaveſt.</hi> O beloved, what a God do ye ſerve! your maſters are not pleaſed with your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to work, if you do not labour with your hands; you ſerve a God which
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:122181:41"/>takes will for work; God takes purpoſes if they be reall, for performances. The Lord doth recompenſe not only gracious performances, but alſo gracious purpoſes in his own ſervants.</p>
            <p>The Uſe or corollary from hence is this:</p>
            <p>That wicked men look to it, God will not only puniſh their wicked practiſes, but their wicked purpoſes: Didſt thou ever purpoſe to be unclean, and it may be thou waſt interrupted, that thou couldſt not have ſecrecy and opportunity? why, God will puniſh thee for thy purpoſe, though thou never doſt act it. Beloved, it is not only what evill thou haſt done, but what evill thou wouldſt have done: Wouldſt not thou have been an oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, if the world would not have cry'd ſhame on thee? wouldſt not thou have been a drunkard, if the world would not brand thee with infamy? God will pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh wicked men for evill purpoſes.</p>
            <p>Further to godly men, Thou canſt not mourn, but wouldſt thou mourn? thou canſt not confeſſe ſin, but wouldſt thou confeſſe ſin? thou canſt not break thy heart, but wouldſt thou break thy heart? God looks on your purpoſes with appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, as well as your practiſes.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, God doth not only look on wicked mens purpoſes to puniſh them for
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:122181:42"/>them, and good mens purpoſes to reward them for them; but God doth look on the purpoſes of devils to do hurt, for to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent them: A notable paſſage, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Peter, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Satan hath deſired to winnow thee like wheat, I have</hi> (actually) <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</hi> the hurt was only the devils purpoſe, and the devils deſire; but when the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation was but in the deſire, then ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I have</hi> actually <hi>prayed for thee.</hi> O fall down and admire the condeſcenſion of Chriſt, he doth crown your purpoſes and endeavours, and deſires: <hi>I ſaid I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe my tranſgreſſion, and thou haſt forgiven the iniquity of my ſin.</hi>

               </label> The Doctrine I am now to handle is this,
that there is a neceſſary connexion between a penitentiall confeſſion of ſin, and forgiveneſſe of ſin, <hi>I confeſſed, and God forgave.</hi> You have frequent teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies that inculcate this on your thoughts, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.13. <hi>He that covereth his ſins, ſhall not proſper; but whoſo confeſſeth and forſaketh them, ſhall have mercy.

            </p>
            <p>In the handling of this point, there are theſe particulars which I ſhall diſpatch.</p>
            <p>Firſt, What is meant by forgiving ſin;
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:122181:42"/>To explicate this, there are three things which are needful to be ſpoken to.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Part. </seg>1</label> Firſt, for the varieties of names and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of forgiveneſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, Pardon of ſin is a caſting of ſin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the back, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 38.17. <hi>Behold for Peace I had great bitterneſſe, but thou haſt in love to my ſoul, delivered it from the pit of corruption, for thou haſt cast all my ſins behinde thy back.</hi> In Scripture to caſt a thing behind the back, ſignifies to forget &amp; diſregard it; ſo wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men caſt Gods Covenant behind their backs; that is, they doe not minde it, they will not obey it: ſo when God is ſaid to caſt ſin behinde his back, hee will take no notice of it ſo as to puniſh it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> A ſecond expreſſion that illuſtrates par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin is this, it is called a caſting of ſin into the bottom of the Sea, <hi>Micah</hi> 7.17. <hi>He will turn again, he will have compaſſion upon us, he will ſubdue our iniquities, and will caſt all our ſins into the depths of the Sea.</hi> It is an alluſion unto Gods great Judgement on <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Hoſt, when they purſued the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> they came to the Red Sea, and thinking to goe through as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did, the Sea fell in upon them, and they were drowned in the bottom of the Sea: ſo ſaith God, <hi>I will deal with ſin as I dealt with Pharaoh</hi> you ſhal never be troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led more with them, not unto condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, you need not fear the riſing of ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:122181:43"/>againſt you; ſin is not like unto light weeds in the Sea, that will ſwim of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but Lead that is caſt into the Sea, the alluſion holds here, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.10. <hi>Thou didſt blow with the wind, the Sea covered them, they ſank as lead in the mighty waters.</hi> God when he pardons ſins he caſts them into the bottom of the Sea, it lies like lead, it can never riſe of it ſelf in a way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to a juſtified man, to a pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſinner.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, Pardon of ſin is expreſſed in Scripture, by blotting out, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent ye therefore, and be converted, that your ſins may be blotted out, &amp;c. Iſa.</hi> 43.25, <hi>I, even I am he, that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions for mine owne ſake.</hi> This is a metaphor taken from men, when a man is not able to pay his debt, the Creditor doth cancel the Bond, blots out the writing and breaks the Seal, that nothing ſhall prevail in Law againſt this poore man. So the Lord doth cancell the bond, and blots out the writing, that neither ſin, nor the Devill ſhall have any proceſſe againſt him in a way of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, Pardon of ſin is expreſſed in Scripture by acquitting of a man from his iniquity, <hi>Job</hi> 10.14. <hi>If I ſin, then thou mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est me, and thou wilt not, or, acquit me</hi> (not ſet me free) <hi>from mine iniquity.</hi> Acquitting is equivalent to a term of Law, giving you a
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:122181:43"/>diſcharge and diſmiſſion of the Court; the Lord in pardoning of ſin, gives a man a legall diſcharge, that no proceedings of heaven ſhall goe againſt him.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, Pardon of ſin is called in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a covering of ſin, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1. <hi>Bleſſed is he whoſe tranſgreſſion is forgiven, whoſe ſin is cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> Beloved, if pardon of ſin had conſiſted in the removing of ſin, we had been undone, pardon of ſin doth not conſiſt in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movall of all ſin out of a man, but in the covering of ſin; God will hide ſin, that the fierceneſſe of his wrath, and the Eye of his indignation ſhall not look on it to condemnation. It is the ſame word that refers to garments, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. If a man hath a Mole or Wenne on his body which his garment covers, theſe infirmities are not ſeen by men. Beloved, God covers ſin as with a garment, to wit, with the long robe of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, ſin is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in thee by the righteouſneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixtly, Pardon of ſinne is expreſſed in Scripture, by waſhing and purging a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of ſin, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 51.2. <hi>Waſh me through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from mine iniquity, and clenſe me from my ſin;</hi> he means there in reference to juſtification, not Sanctification; That pardon of ſin preſents a man to God without ſpot, or wrinckle, or blemiſh, or any ſuch thing, that though you have many ſpots in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:122181:44"/>of your ſanctification, yet you have no ſpot in regard of your juſtification.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Seaventhly, pardon of ſin is expreſſed in Scripture, by not remembring of ſin, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.34. <hi>For I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their ſin no more.</hi> It is an allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Scape-goat, which was to bear the ſins of the people on his head to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them into the land of forgetfulneſſe; Thus the Lord that remembers all things, that God is ſaid graciouſly not to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the ſins of his people, not to remember them ſo, as to damn them for them, <hi>hee will forget your iniquities and remember them no more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Laſtly, Pardon of ſinne is expreſſed in Scripture, by not imputing of ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Bleſſed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute ſin.</hi> It is a word drawn from Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, when they have a friend that owes them money that they care not whether they receive or no, they doe not put it down in their Book. God will not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute ſin, he will not ſet ſin on the ſcore, he will not put ſin to thine account, though ſin be in thee, yet it is not imputed to thee. Thus theſe names or expreſſions do ſomething illuſtrate the nature of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe.</p>
            <p>In the next place, to enquire how many wayes a ſin may be ſaid to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given.</p>
            <pb n="71" facs="tcp:122181:44"/>
            <p>Firſt, in regard of Gods decree, and ſo ſin is forgiven, before all Worlds, becauſe God intended to deliver the Elect, that ſuch a remnant and number of men ſhould have ſin pardoned.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Sin is ſaid to be forgiven when the Lord doth manifeſt forgiveneſſe of ſin.</p>
            <p>Thirdly and chiefly, Sin is ſaid to bee forgiven, when the eternall guilt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation due for that ſin is taken away, when God doth expiate or take off the guilt of ſin, in that properly lies the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of forgiveneſſe.</p>
            <p>In the third place what is conſidered in ſin, when God is ſaid to forgive it; this is worth your underſtanding.</p>
            <p>Three things are to be conſidered in ſinne.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the blot and pollution of ſin; and this cannot be taken away by pardon, the ſin is a ſin, though it be pardoned, the pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of ſin is not taken away by pardon, the blot remains.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is conſidered the deſert of ſin, it deſerves damnation, and the wrath of God; though it be pardoned, this is not taken away.</p>
            <p>Third thing conſidered is this, the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination or appointment of a ſinner to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall puniſhment; and this is fully taken away by pardon, when God doth give re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:122181:45"/>of ſin, he doth take away all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to wrath, death, hell, and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and this is properly the nature of forgiveneſſe of ſin, it is a gracious and a free act of God, whereby he acquits a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner from eternall guilt and eternall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, that is due to all his ſins in an eternall puniſhment, God doth not acquit a pardoned man from externall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, God may pardon thy ſin, yet hee may puniſh thee externally for thy ſins, but not eternally; And thus much for the firſt particular.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Part. </seg>2</label> The ſecond particular is, What kind of confeſſion of ſin is it that hath ſuch a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary connexion with forgiveneſſe of ſin, <hi>I confeſt and thou forgaveſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For anſwer in the generall, it is not eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry kind of confeſſion that carries a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of pardon, <hi>Saul</hi> confeſt his ſin, but God did not take away his ſin, but tooke away his kingdom. It is not every kind of confeſſion that hath a connexion with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe of ſin, but that confeſſion which hath connexion with pardon of ſin, it hath ſix concomitants joined with it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, it is a free and ingenuous confeſſion, not extorted by force, not with ſinful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, but a free, aſul, &amp; ingenuous confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that is the meaning of that phraſe, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 32.21. <hi>Bleſſed is the man to whom the Lord impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth notiniquity, and in whoſe ſpirit there is no guil;</hi>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:122181:45"/>Guile is not there taken largely in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to hypocriſie, but for a ſinfull reſerve of ſin, when a man will not be free and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in confeſſing his ſin unto God; <hi>David</hi> would freely &amp; fully open himſelf &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs his evils unto God; that confeſſion that is a free and ingenuous confeſſion, it hath pardon of ſin annexed to it the confeſſions of them that rowle ſin under the tongue, as a ſweet morſell that they would not part with, have not juſtification entail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on them; thoſe confeſſions onely are connected with forgiveneſſe that are inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous and free.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, that confeſſion which hath pardon annexed to it is a penitentiall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, a confeſſion that hath ſorrow of heart mixt with it, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 38.18. <hi>For I will declare mine iniquity, I will be ſorry for my ſin:</hi> True confeſſion of ſin is rather a voice of mourning, then a voice of words, it hath ever a ſorrow and grief of heart joined with it; That preſcription, that God gave to the Leper in the Law, that he ſhould be clenſed from his leproſie, and in <hi>Levit.</hi> 13.45. <hi>And the Leper in whom the plague is, his clothes ſhall be rent, and his head bare, and hee ſhall put a covering upon his upper lip, and ſhall cry <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean, unclean,</hi> is worth your notice, he was to cry twice, <hi>I am unclean, I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean;</hi> there was his confeſſion, but what was joined with his confeſſion before hee
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:122181:46"/>could be cleanſed? Two things he muſt do, Firſt, he muſt <hi>rent his clothes,</hi> to note, that God muſt have brokenneſſe of heart, and ſorrow of heart joined with confeſſion of ſin. Secondly, he muſt <hi>cover his lip,</hi> to note ſhame that muſt be mingled with his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, to ſhew, that to us that have an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean leproſie of ſin in us, the crying <hi>I am unclean, unclean,</hi> is not enough; but there muſt be <hi>the renting of the heart,</hi> and <hi>ſhame of face;</hi> theſe muſt be mingled with thoſe confeſſions that have a connexion with forgiveneſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Third Concomitant of confeſſion, that hath pardon annexed to it, is this, That there muſt be a voluntary and a free lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of thoſe ſins which we doe confeſſe. To confeſſe ſin, yet to have a lothneſſe in the ſpirit to part with it, is no reall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing of ſin, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.13. <hi>He that covereth his ſin ſhall not proſper, but who ſo confeſſeth and forſaketh them ſhall have mercy.</hi> Confeſſion is there joined with a forſaking of ſin, in caſe mercy be obtained. One cals confeſſion a ſpiritual vomit, you know a man that is burdned in the ſtomach, would be willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rid of that load on his ſtomach that doth oppreſſe nature; a man that doth confeſſe ſin truly would as willingly be rid of ſin on his Conſcience, as a man that is ſick at his Stomach would be rid of that bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den which doth oppreſſe it, ſuch a confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:122181:46"/>hath pardon annexed with it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, That confeſſion which hath pardon annexed with it, is joined with unfained ſorrow for ſin, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9. <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, that confeſſion that hath pardon annexed to it, is joined with a holy aw and fear of running into the commiſſion of thoſe ſins that we do confeſs to God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.18. compared with <hi>Pſ.</hi> 39.1. <hi>For I wil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare mine iniquity, I will be ſorry for my ſin. I ſaid I will take heed to my wayes, that I ſin not with my tongue. Davids</hi> confeſſing ſin did worke in him a holy awe, and a holy care to take heed of thoſe ſins he had confeſt, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe ſin, and to be bold and adventurous to run into ſin, hath not ſuch a connexion with pardon.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixtly, That confeſſion that hath par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don annexed to it, doth quicken the ſoul to ſtrong and earneſt ſupplication to prayer. <hi>David</hi> confeſt ſin, and his confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion quickened Prayer, <hi>Daniel</hi> confeſt ſin, and confeſſion quickened ſupplication; <hi>Daniel</hi> 9.20. <hi>And while I was ſpeaking, and praying, and confeſſing my ſin, and the ſin of my people Iſrael, &amp;c.</hi> Beloved, when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of ſin are to prayer, as the whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone to the knife; when you ſharpen your affections and put a keen edge on your hearts in prayer: this is an evident token that ſuch a confeſſion hath a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with forgiveneſſe of ſin. So
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:122181:47"/>much for the ſecond particular.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Part. </seg>3</label> The third particular is to ſhew you, How doth this connexion between confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſin and forgiveneſſe of ſin conſiſt with the freeneſſe of Gods grace in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning of ſin, in placing a connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween pardon and confeſſion?

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> Firſt, If we ſhould place a cauſality or a merit in confeſſion of ſin to procure pardon, as the Papiſts doe, this would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow the free Grace of God in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving ſin: though we doe place a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion between confeſſing ſin and pardon of ſin; yet we doe not place any merit in thoſe confeſſions, we do not place any worth, any cauſality in thoſe confeſſions, that is my firſt anſwer.</p>

In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the means that this is a way to procure pardon.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In regard of the commmand, God doth command us to confeſſe ſin; Now no command of God that he would have us doe, can derogate from his free grace, therefore ſurely this command can no

            <p>Secondly, In regard of means as a way to get pardon: God is the efficient cauſe, and Chriſt is the meritorious cauſe of pardon; but yet confeſſion of ſin is that cauſe which Logicians call <hi>(Cauſa ſine qua non)</hi> without which pardon of ſin ſhall never be obtained,

This Objection the Anabaptiſts make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt confeſsion of ſin. For anſwer;</p>

               </label> Firſt, Negatively, we doe not confeſſe ſin becauſe only of Gods Soveraignty, becauſe God will have us to confeſſe ſin, Gods Soveraignty may command us and ſay, You ſhal come with ropes about your Necks, and I will make you lie in the duſt.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, We doe not confeſſe ſin, to inform God of our ſins, for God knoweth all things.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, We doe not confeſſe ſinne by way of ſatisfaction, as if our confeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on could ſatisfie Gods juſtice for the wrong we have done him.</p>
            <p>But Poſitively, though God doth know our ſins, yet we are bound to
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:122181:48"/>coonfeſſe our ſinnes upon many ſolid grounds; As,</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, though God doth ſee our ſins, yet we are bound to confeſſe our ſins that we may ſee them our ſelves, that we may put memory and conſcience and heart a work, in the review and in the remembrance of our evils, we do not confeſſe ſin to inform God, but our ſelves, that we might ſee ſin more diſtinctly, and ſo put conſcience a work.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, We doe confeſſe ſin, to ſtir up more ſorrow for ſin, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 38. verſ. 18.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, We confeſs ſin on this ground, that by confeſsing ſin to God, we might ſee ſin to become exceeding ſinfull. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion of ſin ſaith <hi>Bernard,</hi> is enjoined by God for this reaſon; that thou mighteſt magnifie the greatneſſe of grace, and ſee the greatneſſe of ſin; if a man ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee his ſin, hee could never magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie Gods grace and pardoning mercy.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, That you might more prize the merits of Chriſt. Should a man never confeſſe ſin to God, he would never ſee of what value Chriſts bloud is of. A Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians skill is not ſeen in healing a ſlight green wound; but in the healing a man of a deadly diſeaſe: Beloved, an ordinary plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter can cure a green wound; if you look on your ſins as green wounds, you will
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:122181:49"/>never prize Chriſt, nor put an eſtimate on his merits and bloud, when a man can confeſſe his evill, with all its hainous circumſtances, this doth greaten the merits of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, You are to confeſſe ſin, becauſe the confeſsion of ſin doth give glory to the attributes of God; it gives glory to his Omniſciency, you doe by your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsions acknowledge that God ſeeth your ſins: it gives glory to his Patience that he would ſpare you in the act of ſin, that he would not throw you to hell in the very act of ſin: it gives glory to his Juſtice, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 51.4. <hi>Againſt thee, thee onely have I ſinned, and done this evill in thy ſight, that thou mighteſt be juſtified when thou ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and be clear when thou judgeſt:</hi> it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth Gods Mercy, and this <hi>Paul</hi> doth, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. <hi>who was before a Blaſphemer, and a perſecutor, and injurious; but I obtained mercy, &amp;c.</hi> He confeſt his ſin that ſo hee might greaten the aboundance of Gods grace and love.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Again, Of confeſsion of ſin there is great uſe, becauſe it doth eaſe the minde, it gives vent to a troubled minde, concealed guilt breeds horrour and hell in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; it is an ingenuous clearneſſe when a man can open himſelf to God in free confeſsion, which doth allay the anguiſh and trouble of minde, <hi>Job</hi> 32.18. <hi>For I

            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>2</label> A ſecond Objection is this, I, but you will ſay, what need ſuch preſſing of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing of ſin, as having a connexion with pardon? for as God is never the better by my grace; ſo God is never the worſe by my ſin: as my grace addes nothing to Gods holineſſe, ſo my ſin can detract nothing from Gods glory; for God is neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe glorious though I be never ſo much ſinfull: One might urge as <hi>Elihu</hi> did in <hi>Job</hi> 5.37. <hi>If thou be righteous, what giveſt thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand?</hi> verſ. 8. <hi>Thy wickedneſſe may hurt a man as thou art, and thy righteouſneſſe may profit the ſon of man.</hi> Therefore if God receives no injury by my ſin, what need I confeſſe ſin to God? Beloved, this is an objection that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomians make: For anſwer,</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> Firſt, It is true, God is not the worſe, and hath not the leſſe glory, though thou haſt the more ſin; yet this is no thanks to a ſinner, for a ſinner doth, what in him
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:122181:50"/>lies to take all glory from God, to pull God out of heaven, it is no thankes to thee that God is never the worſe for thy ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, In a ſenſe God doth receive injury by a mans ſin; as firſt, if you conſider the eternall attributes of God in themſelves, his Juſtice, his Glory, his Goodneſſe, his Wiſdom, ſo God is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, immutably bleſſed: and as our graces can give no additions to his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; ſo our ſin can give no diminution to his glory, ſin is an injury to God becauſe God hath leſſe externall glory.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, Though our ſins can doe no injury to God, to make God unholy, or to make God unhappy; yet ſin doth great injury to your ſelves; if thou beeſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, what wilt thou doe againſt God? why, thou canſt not bring God out of heaven, though thou maiſt bring thy ſelf into hell, God receives no diminution of his holineſſe, of his wiſdom, of his glory, by thy ſinfulneſſe, yet thou ſhalt not have glory, holineſſe, happineſſe, heaven, nor eternall life, thou ſhalt receive miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries by thine own ſins; And thus I have done with the Doctrinall part of this point; to wit, that there is a neceſſary connexion, between mens confeſſing ſin and Gods act in forgiving of ſin.</p>
            <p>I now come to the Uſe, which is for
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:122181:50"/>triall, to put you on a diligent enquiry, how you may know whether God hath brought you into a pardoned eſtate, and hath forgiven the iniquity of your ſin; how may it be known whether God hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given you your iniquities? There are ten ways to diſcover this, I ſhal divide them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this order, there are ſix Concomitants, that doe attend a perſon in a pardoned e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and four characters laid downe in Scripture of a man whoſe ſin is forgiven him. Firſt, the Concomitants or thoſe things in the Scripture which doe attend or accompany a perſon whoſe ſin is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, In Scripture we find that remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſin is accompanied with renovation of the heart, if ſin be remitted the heart is renewed; they are both joined together, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.17. <hi>To him that overcometh, will I give to eat of the hidden Manna, and will give him a white ſtone, and in the ſtone a new name written, which no man knoweth, ſaving he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Interpreters doe give this ſenſe of that promiſe, you read of two things, <hi>a white Stone,</hi> and <hi>a new name written in that ſtone,</hi> the white ſtone, it is an expreſſion, borrowed from the practiſe of the Gentiles, who in their Judicature did uſe a white ſtone; If a malefactour was condemned, and had the ſentence of death paſt upon him, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:122181:51"/>was given him a black ſtone in token of condemnation; but if a man had a white ſtone given him, it was a token of abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or pardon. In alluſion to this, Chriſt doth hore promiſe pardon of ſin, which is meant by the white ſtone; but what muſt be written on this ſtone? there muſt be written on this white ſtone, a new Name, that is, renovation, the renewing of the heart: ſo that if ſo be, the nature of a man be not renewed, the ſin of a man is not pardoned; therefore do not boaſt of having your white ſtone, if there be a blank on that ſtone, if there be nothing written on that ſtone, if holineſſe be not written on that ſtone, pardon of ſin hath renewing of nature to attend it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> A ſecond Concomitant is this, Remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by forgiveneſſe of ſin, is accompanied with endearedneſſe of love to Jeſus Chriſt: this is laid down in <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.47. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſay unto thee, her ſins which are many are forgiven, for ſhe loved much.</hi> It is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant that did attend her pardon, much was forgiven her, therefore ſhe loved much.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, Forgiveneſſe of ſin, is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied in Scripture, with a cordiall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of ſin unto God: <hi>I adknowledged my tranſgreſſions unto the Lord, and thou forga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt the iniquity of my ſin.</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9. <hi>If we confeſſe our ſins, he is faithfull and juſt to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:122181:51"/>forgive us our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, Forgiveneſſe of ſin, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied in Scripture, with a cordiall forgiving other men all the perſonall wrongs and injuries that they have done you. <hi>Mat</hi> 18.35. <hi>So likewiſe ſhall my hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father do unto you, if ye from your heart forgive not every one his brother their treſpaſſes:</hi> It is in the Lords prayer annexed, <hi>forgive us our treſpaſſes, Mat.</hi> 6. So that forgiving of other men is in Scripture as an Attendant or Concomitant of Gods forgiving us, <hi>Put on as the Elect of God,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>bowels of mercy, forbearing and forgiving one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> A fifth Concomitant that attends for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe of ſin, is repentance from dead works: repentance for ſin is a Concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant that is ever joyned with the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſin: <hi>Act.</hi> 5.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>1. <hi>Him hath God exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, for to give repentance to Iſrael, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe of ſins.</hi> There they are linckt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to give repentance and remiſſion of ſin. It is a Queſtion among the Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Whether God by his abſolute pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er can forgive a man his ſin, if a man doth not repent him of his ſin. There are few of them that do incline to the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, becauſe God hath expreſly tied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the Word, that pardon muſt have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for ſin.</p>
            <pb n="86" facs="tcp:122181:52"/>
            <p>Sixtly, Forgiveneſſe of ſin, is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with holy endeavours for the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of ſin: he that hath the guilt of ſin pardoned, labours to have the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of ſin deſtroyed; therefore in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture pardoning mercy and ſubduing grace, they are both joyned together, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.19. <hi>He will turn again, he will have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion upon us, he will ſubdue our iniquities, and thou wilt caſt all their ſins into the depths of the Sea:</hi> there is ſubduing grace as well as pardoning mercy. Beloved, if God pardon ſin, there are reall endeavours in a ſoul to have the power of ſin taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. Indeed many men in the world do lay claim to pardon, who never have endeavours and holy purſuits after mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification: many have counterfeit morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, who play with their ſins like Fencers; which it may be give them a touch, a ſlight blow, but do not fight like warriers, either to kill or be kill'd: but godly men do not play with their ſins, but doe with their luſts as a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier, they do conflict with luſts on theſe terms, that either we muſt kill them, or they will kill us. Many counterfeit Chriſtians who do lay claim to reall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, have but counterfeit mortifications: I may ſitly reſemble ſuch men as theſe to the <hi>Perſians,</hi> who had one Feſtivall annual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly where they uſed this cuſtome, that
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:122181:52"/>they laboured to finde out all their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous creatures, as Snakes, Serpents, and the like: and one day in the year they would kill all which they found, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards they let them encreaſe. Many men in ſome ſolemn performances to God, will make great adoe of killing their luſts, but afterwards they let them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and live again. And thus much for the ſix Concomitants that do attend a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in a pardoned ſtate.</p>
            <p>The next is, the Characters to be given of a pardoned man, of a man whoſe ſin is forgiven; I will name but four Characters of a pardoned ſinner.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Char. </seg>1</label> Firſt, this, He who is brought into a pardoned eſtate, doth greatly admire God, and abaſe ſelf: this is laid down in the 7. of <hi>Micah,</hi> the Prophet brings in the Churches crying out in the extolling of God, <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, pardoning iniquity, tranſgreſſion and ſin!</hi> a pardoned man ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires God, becauſe his grace is free, and his bounty is great: and a pardoned man abaſeth ſelf, becauſe he ſeeth ſin exceeding ſinfull, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.</p>

               <label type="milestone">

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:122181:53"/>it coſt Chriſt much bloud to expiate the guilt of that ſin; it coſt him many tears to deſtroy the power of that ſin; now that ſin which he hath ſmarted for, and Chriſt hath ſuffered for, he will not eaſily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38. when the Pſalmiſt ſaid, he would <hi>declare his iniquity:</hi> then in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39. he ſaith, <hi>I will take heed to my wayes,</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, I am ſorry for my ſin, and the Lord hath forgiven me mine iniquity: but here is the reſult of it, I will take heed to my wayes, and of my ſinning another time: there is no man that knoweth his ſin to be pardoned, that can eaſily run into the commiſſion of it again. It is an excellent expreſſion in the book of <hi>Job</hi> 10.14. <hi>If I ſin, then thou mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt me, and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity.</hi> If I ſin, it is not here ſpoken ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely and ſimply; for what man is he that lives and ſinneth not? but if I ſin as I am charged, that I ſhould ſin murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly and maliciouſly againſt God, and I will perſiſt in my ſin, ſaith <hi>Job, If I ſin</hi> as they charge me, what followes? <hi>then God will not take away mine iniquity, he will not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don my ſin:</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> ſaid of himſelf, you may ſay of your ſelves; if I ſin obſtinately, and pertinaciouſly, God will not pardon: thou haſt been wiccked, and thou wilt be ſo; thou haſt been prophane, and thou wilt be ſo; This is inconſiſtent with a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned ſtate.</p>

Indeed there may be a forc't, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained ſorrow which may come from the eyes of unpardoned men: there is this difference between the one and the other. Tears in an unpardoned ſinner come from him like water in a Still; but Tears in a pardoned ſinner come from him like water from the clouds: water will drop from the Still, but it is forc't by keeping cloſe the Still, and by the heat of the fire; the fire of hell may make a wicked man agaſt: but ſorrow for ſin in a pardoned man, is like water from the clouds that is not forced but doth natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally drop down.</p>

            <p>Firſt, There is a judicious ſorrow, and this conſiſts in an apprehenſion in the Judgement, that ſin is the greateſt evill in the world, and moſt to be lamented, bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, oppoſed, and reſiſted: Divines do place more ſtrength &amp; height of grace in having an indignation ſtirred up in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding againſt ſin, touching the evill of ſin; this is more then to ſhed a few tears for ſin. Now if thou haſt a judicious ſorrow to apprehend ſin to be a great evill, though it hath not vent at the eye, yet this is god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſorrow for ſin. A man that hath the Tooth-ache, he will cry out and complain more, and ſhed more tears happily for the exquiſite pain of the Tooth-ache, then he will doe in the burning Feaver; yet aske him which he had rather have, he will tell you the Tooth-ache: the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the peſtilentiall Feaver is more ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard ous to life: ſo had you rather loſe your children, then loſe the ſenſe of Gods favour. Which had you rather have, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions in the world, or willingly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſin againſt God?</p>
            <p>The judgement of a man, if he be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate man, tells him he had rather a
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:122181:55"/>thouſand times loſe the deareſt relation, then the manifeſtation of Gods love unto his ſoul; he had rather endure the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt affliction, then to venture willingly on the leaſt ſin.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>4</label> Fourthly, Conſider, that Gods own people have oftentimes expreſt more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for outward afflictions, then they have done for inward corruptions; there is great reaſon for it, becauſe things of ſenſe do more affect us, then things of faith do; lay a man upon the rack, and he ſhall more roar and cry then any man in the world ſhall do in the ſenſe of ſin, becauſe the pain is ſenſitive, and it will have more ſenſe of ſorrow: it was thus with good men in Scripture. We read much of <hi>Davids</hi> ſorrow, he had no reſt in his bones by reaſon of his ſin: yet mark, when <hi>David</hi> loſt <hi>Abſalom,</hi> O what a fit of ſorrow was he in, crying out, <hi>O my ſon</hi> Abſalom, <hi>my ſon, my ſon</hi> Abſalom, <hi>would God I had dyed for thee, O</hi> Abſalom <hi>my ſon, my ſon.</hi> We do not read of ſuch cryes, O my ſoul, my ſoul, O what ſhall I do for thee my ſoul! becauſe the ſorrow was ſenſitive, the loſſe was ſenſitive.</p>
            <p>Now beloved, Gods people do expreſſe more ſenſitive ſorrow for outward croſſes then for inward corruptions. A late Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor doth quote an inſtance out of <hi>Jerome,</hi> a godly woman loſt her children, and ſhe
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:122181:55"/>wept even to death, yet ſhe could not weep ſo for her ſin: the reaſon is, becauſe things of ſenſe do more affect a man then things of faith; though there be more evill in one ſin then in a thouſand affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
            <p>And thus much for the relief of a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ſinner in anſwer to the firſt Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>

Now this is a miſtake: mortification doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſo farre, but it extends to an aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the dominion of ſin; not of the beeing of ſin: ſin will be in the heart. As the tree in <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.14. <hi>He cryed aloud, and ſaid thus: Hew down the tree, and cut off his bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, ſhake off his leaves, and ſcatter his fruit; let the beaſts get away from under it, and the fowls from his branches; nevertheleſſe leave the ſtump of his roots in the earth:</hi> So ſin in the heart, the branches are cut off by mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, the luxuriant buddings, and bloſſomings, and breakings forth of ſin, they are cut off; but the ſtump, the root of the originall ſin, from which all ſin flowes and growes that remains. <hi>Dan</hi> 7.12. <hi>As concerning the reſt of the beaſts, they had their dominion taken away; yet their lives were prolonged for a ſeaſon and time:</hi> Though thou beeſt a mortified man, yet mortification doth only take away the dominion of ſin, and not the life of it; for it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed for a ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>Again, thou doſt miſtake the nature of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:122181:56"/>mortification, when thou doſt account, that becauſe of the irritations of ſin, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou haſt not the mortifications of ſin. Beloved, luſts may be irritated and ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up in a mortified heart.</p>

            <p>I anſwer, That it is an evident token that Chriſt hath diſpoſſeſt the ſoul of the power of ſin, or taken away the power of ſin, ſeeing the Devill doth labour
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:122181:57"/>to poſſeſſe you ſo often with the guilt of ſin in a way of temptation. Obſerve, if a man did lye under the power of ſin, the Devill would not ſuggeſt to that man the guilt of ſin; becauſe then it would awaken a mans conſcience, and make a poor ſinner look after Jeſus Chriſt, and after heaven, and pardon. Therefore a ſinner under the power and dominion of ſin, ſhall not be troubled under the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill about the guilt of ſin. The Devill had rather play at ſmall game then not to game: if he cannot damn a man by keeping him under the power of ſin, he will terrifie him by troubling him with the guilt of ſin.</p>

It is a text that I have made uſe of in the 11. chapter of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> Divines make great uſe of it for the comforting of troubled conſciences, in the 33. verſ. <hi>And every earthen veſſell, whereinto any of them falleth, whatſoever is in it ſhall be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean: and ye ſhall break it.</hi> Verſ. 36. <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe, a fountain or pit wherein there is plenty of water, ſhall be clean: but that which toucheth their carkaſſe ſhall be unclean.</hi> The ſignificancy of this Law was this, that if ſin do fall upon a pit of water, into a ſtanding pool, becauſe it hath no moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it cannot purge it ſelf from the filth caſt into it, that is unclean: but if an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean thing be caſt into the fountain of water, that cannot be unclean, for it hath a principle in it to purge and free it ſelf from theſe unclean things that are caſt into it, to ſhew, if ſin be in your heart as an unclean thing in a fountain of water, that by reaſon of your continual motion unto God, your running unto God, you have a principle in you to

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>3</label> A third Objection is this, Surely I have miſgiving thoughts, that God hath not forgiven me my ſin, becauſe after I have committed ſin, I do not diſcern that my conſcience checks me for my ſin, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I may fear, if there be no remorſe after the commiſſion of ſin, I may fear that there is no remiſſion. This is the ſtrongeſt Objection to make a man fear his pardon; As I would ſay nothing to make a deluded wretch to preſume, ſo I would keep back nothing that might any way eſtabliſh a troubled minde: thou ſayeſt thou doeſt fall into ſin, yet thou haſt no check and remorſe of conſcience for ſin; therefore thou feareſt if ſin hath no remorſe on thy part, it hath no remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on Gods part.</p>

A godly man that holds an error, conſcience may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſmite him for it, becauſe his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is miſtaken; his judgement thinks he holds the truth, and therefore conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence cannot ſmite him for holding an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>5</label> Fifthly, a ſtep further, It is poſſible that the conſcience of a pardoned ſinner may be in ſo deep a ſleep, and ſo much out of office for a while, that he may rather put
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:122181:60"/>his wits a work to hide his ſin, then his conſcience on work to check him for ſin. To give you an inſtance for this, it is plain in the caſe of <hi>David, David</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted adultery with <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> but he did not put his conſcience on work to check him for his ſin, but he did put his wits on work to hide the ſin.

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi>'s death, that ſo there might be no clamour on his part for the defilement of his wife.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixthly, This is the furtheſt ſtep of all, take this for thy comfort, It is poſſible that the conſcience of a pardoned ſinner

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Take this for a difference, though the conſcience of a pardoned man may not for a time ſmite him for ſin com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, yet he doth not take that courſe to ſtifle the checks, and to ſtill the voice of conſcience as reprobates doe: wicked men take ſenſuall delights to ſtill the checks and voice of conſcience, ſo <hi>Saul</hi> did 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.14. <hi>But the ſpirit of the Lord departed from</hi> Saul, <hi>and an evill ſpirit from the Lord troubled him.</hi> Verſ. 17. <hi>And</hi> Saul <hi>ſaid unto his ſervants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me.</hi> When an evill ſpirit troubled him, that was his conſcience, <hi>Saul</hi> called for muſick to ſtill the voice of conſcience.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Good men care not for jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:122181:62"/>company, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.18. <hi>For</hi> John <hi>had ſaid unto</hi> Herod, <hi>It is not lawfull for thee to have thy brothers wife.</hi> Verſ. 21. <hi>And when a convenient day was come, that</hi> Herod <hi>on his birthday made a ſupper to his lords, high captains, and chief eſtates of Galilee, &amp;c.</hi> Good men dare not avoid a reproving, a ſearching mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry: as <hi>Felix</hi> did, <hi>Act.</hi> 24.25. <hi>And as he reaſoned of righteouſneſſe, temperance, and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come,</hi> Felix <hi>trembled, and anſwered, Goe thy way for this time, when I have conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſeaſon I will call for thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He could not indure to lye under a gaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Miniſtry, godly men do not thus; if a man be pardoned, though he hath ſin, yet he is glad when the Miniſtry doth arowſe and awaken his conſcience.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, A pardoned ſinner dares not content himſelf under a dawbing and a flattering Miniſtry, that will ſew pillowes under his elbowes, and ſay peace when there is none, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.13. <hi>And I have ſeen folly in the Prophets of Samaria, they propheſied in</hi> Baal, <hi>and cauſed my people</hi> Iſrael <hi>to erre.</hi> Verſ. 14. <hi>I have ſeen alſo in the Prophets of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, an horrible thing; they commit adultery, and walk in lies; they ſtrengthen alſo the hands of evill doers, that none doth return from his wickedneſſe: they are all of them unto me as</hi> Sodom, <hi>and the inhabitants of them as</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah. Chap. 8.11. <hi>For they have healed the hurt of the Daughter of my people ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:122181:62"/>ſaying, Peace, peace, when there is no peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, They dare not run into the croud of imployments, that ſo they might forget the gawlings of conſcience, as <hi>Cain</hi> did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. <hi>Cain</hi> to put off the troubles of his conſcience, would fall to buying, building, and drowning himſelf in the world, that ſo he might hear no more. A pardoned ſinner doth not thus, but if conſcience ſuggeſts guilt, he prayes to God that conſcience might ſpeak through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and home to the heart.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, A godly man doth not wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and continue in a cuſtome of ſin, that ſo cuſtome in his ſin, might take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way conſcience of his ſin. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.19. <hi>Who being paſt feeling, have given themſelves over to laſciviouſneſſe, to work all uncleanneſſe with greedineſſe.</hi> Wicked men give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves over to a cuſtome in ſin, that ſo they might not have conſcience to ſmite them for ſin. They are like a Smiths dog, a ſtrange dog that comes to a Smiths forge, cannot abide to have the ſparkles of fire flie about him; but that dog that hath alwayes been accuſtomed to the ſhop, can ſleep ſtill on, and it never troubles him: wicked men are like Smiths dogs uſed to the ſhop, though flaſhes of hell fire are caſt about them, yet they ſleep ſtill and are not awakened; but godly men do not
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:122181:63"/>make uſe of cuſtome in ſin to lull them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep in their ſweet luſts.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> A third difference, That though the conſcience of a pardoned ſinner doth not ſmite him for ſin, yet is it ſooner and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier awakened and raiſed out of a dead ſleep, then the conſcience of a wicked man; a look from Jeſus eye, and the Cock crowing made <hi>Peter</hi> weep, <hi>he went out and wept bitterly,</hi> a rebuke to <hi>David</hi> from the Prophet, made him cry out, <hi>Lord I have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi> A reprobate conſcience is not ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily put into office, it doth not reprove him, there muſt be much adoe and great labour taken before his dead conſcience will hear the rebukes of the Word, there is more a doe with a wicked man to have his conſcience in office then with a godly man.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, There is this difference, though the conſcience of a good man be a ſleep for a time, and doth not ſmite him for ſin, yet ſome time before he dyes, his conſcience ſhall ſmite him for ſin, there is no godly man in the world but under known ſins, if his conſcience hath not ſmitten him, his conſcience ſhall ſmite him before he dyes, but wicked men live and dye in ſin, and never have the controll or rebuke of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: <hi>Ahaz</hi> was troubled by affliction from God, yet conſcience never trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him, for he did yet more wickedly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God.</p>
            <pb n="109" facs="tcp:122181:63"/>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, Though the conſcience of a pardoned ſinner may be aſleep for a time, and may not reprove him for ſin commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; yet a good mans conſcience when it doth reprove him, it doth check him more out of a ſenſe of ſin and the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour done to God, then out of fear of hell or any outward judgements; but wicked men are aſleep in their conſciences, and if conſcience doth ever awake, it is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſin is ſin, and becauſe God is diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured; but becauſe there is hell for ſin, and becauſe there are outward grievous judgements; when God breaks men by his judgements, then they will put con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience on work, but never doe it out of ſenſe of ſin; Take this compariſon of Ducks in a pond of water, caſt but a little peble ſtone into the water, and it will make them dive, but let it rattle and thunder in the heavens, the Ducks feare not; a Divine makes this a fit embleme of a wicked mans conſcience, caſt but a little peble ſtone, ſome preſent affliction neer a wicked man, and that will make him dive, that will trouble conſcience and perplex the man; but let God thunder from heaven, let the Lord declare all the threatnings of his ſpirituall judgements againſt ſin, how evill ſin is, how God is diſhonoured by ſin, and how the ſoule is indangered, all theſe thundrings from
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:122181:64"/>heaven cannot make him ſtartle.</p>
            <p>And thus I have run haſtily over the anſwering of this third Objection, I have done it meerly for a relief of a perplexed Conſcience, thus I have done with this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, <hi>I confest, and thou forgaveſt, Thou for gaveſt,</hi> to forgive ſaith <hi>Muſeulus,</hi> is a word of favor or grace, not merit, or ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>thou forgaveſt,</hi> It notes pardon of ſin is not vouchſafed to men by way of debt, but of gift; <hi>I confeſſed and thou forgaveſt,</hi> thou forgaveſt what? <hi>Thou forgaveſt the iniquity of my ſin,</hi> the ſin of my ſin, Interpreters have various apprehenſions touching the meaning of theſe words, what it is for God to forgive the iniquity of my ſin. I will bring it to a two fold channell: Some there are that by iniquity, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the puniſhment of ſin; <hi>I acknowledged my ſin, and thou forgaveſt the iniquity of my ſin;</hi> That is, thou forgaveſt <hi>the puniſhment of my ſin,</hi> the reaſon of that interpretation is becauſe in the Hebrew language the ſame word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that ſignifies <hi>iniquity,</hi> ſignifies <hi>puniſhment,</hi> and therefore they underſtand the <hi>iniquity of ſin,</hi> the <hi>puniſhment of ſin;</hi> but Interpreters generally go againſt this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, for uſually the word is taken for ſin it ſelf; Again, the whole ſcope of the Pſalm is not in ſeeking the outward puniſhment to be forgiven; but the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe of ſin is referred to eternall guilt.</p>
            <pb n="111" facs="tcp:122181:64"/>
            <p>Thirdly, Here is in the Text a <hi>Selah,</hi> which is a note of attention, a note of admiration annexed to this expreſſion, <hi>Thou haſt forgiven, &amp;c.</hi> ſurely that would be no wonder to God to paſſe by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall puniſhment, for that he might do to men whoſe ſins were never pardoned: What is it for God to forgive the <hi>iniquity of ſin?</hi> I anſwer, the <hi>iniquity of ſin</hi> is meant, that God out of his free grace doth not onely ſimply forgive a ſin committed, but he forgives the iniquity of that ſin, all the malignity of that ſin, all the hainous ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated circumſtances, that may any ways make it great. A learned Authour ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a whole Tract upon this Pſalm, hath theſe words, the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> uſeth this kinde of ſpeech, <hi>To forgive the iniquity of ſinne, that hee might teach us, that it was no light fault that was pardoned, it was ſin, and it was the iniquity of ſin, ſin upon ſin, and ſin greatned by many hainous circumſtances.</hi> Yet, Behold! the great mercy of God, <hi>Thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaveſt the iniquity of my ſin;</hi> thus much for the explaining of the words.</p>
            <p>The Obſervation is this; <hi>That ſuch are the riches of Gods pardoning grace, that he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives his people not onely ſin in the generall, but their great ſins, ſuch as are cloathed with many aggravated and hainous crying circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. Thou forgaveſt the iniquity of my ſinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the handling of this point I ſhall proceed in this method:</p>
            <pb n="112" facs="tcp:122181:65"/>
            <p>Firſt, To prove the point to you by an Induction of particular inſtances; then the application of it by ſeverall uſes. It is a point full of comfort, and indeed I know not ſuch a Text in all the Bible that ſpeaks of Gods grace in pardoning aggravated ſins ſins, more clearly then this Text doth.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all, I ſhall give you an induction of inſtances, that God doth not only for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give his people a bare ſin convicted, but God doth out of the riches of his Grace forgive his people thoſe ſins that you may call the <hi>iniquity of ſin,</hi> ſins cloathed with many hainous aggravated circumſtances. The inſtance of <hi>David,</hi> that ſpeakes the words, an inſtance of <hi>Peter,</hi> another of <hi>Paul,</hi> many men that have ſinned againſt light and love, ſinned againſt cheks of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and againſt mercies, are theſe ſins forgiven? Yes, that is my work to prove, that Gods grace doth forgive ſins that are cloathed with many hainous and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated circumſtances to make them great.</p>
            <p>Firſt,

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, O know it for thy comfort O thou diſconſolate heart, let thy ſin bee never ſo great, yet the mercies of God are greater. <hi>Sabian,</hi> a learned Interpreter, gives to my hand which is his inſtance,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:122181:70"/>Lord my fault is great, but thy mercies are greater; Beloved, I may ſay to you, though thy ſin be great, yet the mercy of God is greater then thy ſin, and thou canſt not have ſo many circumſtances to greaten thy ſin, as can be produced in God to greaten his own mercy: you ſhall read what he ſaith of himſelfe in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 44.22. <hi>I have blotted out as a thick cloud thy tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and as a cloud, thy ſins, return unto mee, for I have redeemed thee.</hi> Suppoſe thy ſin be not onely a little cloud; but ſuppoſe it be a great cloud, <hi>a thick cloud</hi> ſaith God, I do not onely blot ſins out like a little cloud: but I will blot out tranſgreſſions that are like a thick cloud; great ſins as well as ſmall doth the mercies of God cover. The Sea can as well cover great rocks as little peble ſtones, high mountains as well as mole-hils: Gods mercy is an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean that can cover great enormities as well as leſſer infirmities. The glorious body of the Sun in the heavens, can ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the greateſt miſt as well as the thinneſt vapour: great ſins as well as ſmall are pardoned by mercy.

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:122181:71"/>Seat covered all the commands; to teach you this, that the mercy of God can par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the greateſt violation of the Law, therefore that wherein the Law was kept was all covered by the Mercy Seat.</p>

Though thou haſt need to ſhed more tears for ſin in a way of contrition; yet Chriſt need not ſhed more bloud for ſin in a way of redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for he hath ſaved them to the utmoſt that come unto God by him: the Apoſtle triumphing in the 5. of the <hi>Romans,</hi> hee means there, that there is not ſo much evil in ſin to damne us, as there is good in the gift, in Chriſt, for to ſave, becauſe thy ſin is the guilt of a creature, and Chriſts ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction is the ſatisfaction of a God; thy ſin, the ſinne of a finite creature, and his

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Third Conſolation is this, to you that are perplexed in Conſcience, that you have committed hainous and aggravated ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, yet that Jeſus Chriſt by converſion doth wipe away the infamy &amp; the ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thy moſt horrid and ſcandalous ſins, before converſion. Suppoſe thou haſt bin a notorious infamous creature; yet Chriſt takes off the ignominy and the infamy of thy ſin by Converſion: It is obſervable of <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> ſhee was a notorious whore, every one that ſaw her knew ſhee was a common harlot; <hi>there was a woman that was a ſinner,</hi> the meaning was, ſhe was an infamous notorious harlot; What is done when Chriſt converted this woman? <hi>Verily, I ſay unto you, that where ever the Goſpell is preached, it ſhall be ſpoken what this woman hath done, throughout the whole world,</hi> Chriſt did wipe away the infamy of harlotry, he would have renowned the love of that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to Chriſt, he would have it ſpoken of where ever the Goſpel was preacht, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.47. <hi>Wherefore I ſay unto thee, her ſinnes which are many are forgiven, for ſhe loved much.</hi> Chriſt did delight to wipe away the ignominy of her harlotry in her after life. It is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy obſervation, that four women are reckoned in the Genealogy of Chriſt; what women were they? they were women that
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:122181:72"/>were infamous, the beſt of them did fall into much ſcandall, and gave much offence, there you find mention of <hi>Thamar, Rachab, Ruth,</hi> and <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> no more in the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogy but theſe; what were al theſe women? they were converted women; Begin with <hi>Thamar,</hi> ſhe committed uncleanneſſe with her Father in law, an infamous woman, as you have the ſtory in <hi>Gen.</hi> 38.18. <hi>And hee ſaid, What pledge ſhall I give thee? and ſhe ſaid, thy Signet, and thy Bracelets and thy Staffe, that is in thine hand; and he gave it her, and came in unto her, and ſhe conceived by him.</hi> Then you read of <hi>Rachab,</hi> a common harlot, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.31. <hi>By faith the Harlot Rachab periſhed not with them that beleeved not when ſhe had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the ſpies with peace, Matth.</hi> 1.5. <hi>And Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon begat Boos of Rachab, &amp;c.</hi> A third wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man mentioned in the Genealogy is <hi>Ruth,</hi> what was ſhee? ſhe was not ſo infamous as the reſt were, yet ſhe ran into a grievous ſcandall, <hi>Ruth</hi> came of <hi>Moab,</hi> whom <hi>Lot</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat of his own daughter, you have the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the Book of <hi>Geneſis</hi> 19.36. <hi>Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> verſ. 37. <hi>And the firſt born bare a ſon, and called his name Moab.</hi> What was ſhe? for her perſon ſhe was a good woman; but as all Divines obſerve of her, ſhe did an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that had appearance of evill, what did ſhee? read the ſtory in the 3 of <hi>Ruth,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning at the 5. verſe, &amp;c. the ſtory ſaith,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:122181:72"/>that ſhe came alone at midnight to <hi>Bouz,</hi> there was an action full of infamy, which was a ſhamefull thing that a woman ſhould come to a man lying alone. Secondly, ſhe came and lay by him in the night ſeaſon, but it is true, the Scripture clears her for any thing following, verſ. 14. <hi>And ſhe lay at his feet untill morning, and ſhe roſe up before one could know another:</hi> there was no vanity, no folly, and no evill, yet it was a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſcandall for a woman to be with a man, and <hi>Boaz</hi> did fear the ſcandall of it too; yet ſuch a woman as this is reckoned in the Genealogy of Chriſt. The fourth woman is <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> ſhe was unclean with <hi>David.</hi> What is the Myſtery of this? truely all Interpreters give this; There are but four women named in the Genealogy, all of them infamous, and it is recorded that Chriſt came from theſe four, to take off the ignominy and infamy of your ſins that you have fallen into before Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Suppoſe God ſhould ſuffer thee to fall into execrable villanies, reall and ſound converſion to God takes off the reproach and ignominy; therefore Chriſt to take off the ignominy and reproach from theſe women would honour them ſo far, as to reckon them in his own Genealogy.</p>
            <p>The point was this, That ſuch are the riches of Gods pardoning grace, that hee forgives his people the great ſins that
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:122181:73"/>are cloathed with many hainous and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated circumſtances.

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah</hi> for it.</p>
            <p>So likewiſe of <hi>David,</hi> you would think it but a ſmall matter for a King to number his people; yet you know how many thouſands in Iſrael God did take away by the Plague for that very ſin: ſo that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, ſuppoſe thou haſt not fallen into hideous and hainous wickedneſſes, yet thou ſeeſt little ſins diſpleaſe God as well as great; becauſe ſin, though little, yet is againſt a great God, and little ſins diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe as well as great.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, That though groſſe ſins may carry a greater infamy, yet little ſecret ſins may carry a greater guilt in them to God. Beloved, the ſin of Angels, it was but a ſmall ſin, a ſpirituall ſin, only one
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:122181:74"/>ſin, and a ſin in thought too, not of act; yet you know that for that ſin, God did tumble the Angels out of heaven. Indeed groſſe ſins carry a greater infamy, but little ſmall ſins may carry as great a guilt.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Third Conſideration is this, That ſmall and little ſins may be aggravated and cloathed with ſuch circumſtances, as may make them great. Two inſtances in <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, and <hi>Davids</hi> ſin.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, you would account it a ſmall matter to eat an apple or ſome other fruit; but yet that ſmall fact of eating the forbidden fruit, was ſo cloathed with many circumſtances, which made it a great and grievous ſin: for,</p>
            <p>Firſt, If you conſider the ſtate of <hi>Adam,</hi> he was not as we are; but <hi>Adam</hi> was a perfect and an innocent creature: and it is a greater evill for a perfect creature to ſin then for us that are imperfect.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Conſider the place where <hi>Adam</hi> was, it was in Paradiſe, and yet there to ſin.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Conſider the publickneſſe of his perſon, he did not ſin for himſelf; but in his ſin we all ſinned: for a private man to ſin is an evill, but for a publique per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon repreſenting other men, his ſin is other mens ſin.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, How many aggravations
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:122181:74"/>were in the bowels of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin: there are ſix:</p>
            <p>Firſt, There was unbeleif in his ſin, God did not tell them with an <hi>if,</hi> or an <hi>and,</hi> but told them peremptorily they ſhould dye.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There was this aggravation, that <hi>Adam</hi> did beleeve the Devill, before God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, There was pride in this ſin; for ſaith the Devill, <hi>Ye ſhall be as gods,</hi> and that pleaſed them; it was not enough to be man and woman, but they muſt be gods.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, There was curioſity in that ſin, You ſhall be as gods <hi>knowing good and evill;</hi> now out of meer curioſity to know more then they did know, though they knew enough to make them happy and bleſſed, did they plunge themſelves into this ſin.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, They were not contented with their condition.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixthly and laſtly, There was murder in this ſin, for <hi>Adam</hi> kill'd himſelf and all his poſterity; For by one man ſin en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the world and death by ſin, ſo that in him all have ſinned, and ſo all dyed: therefore <hi>Adams</hi> ſin was ſo cloathed with hainous aggravations, that made it very great.</p>
            <p>Look on <hi>Davids</hi> ſin in numbring the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:122181:75"/>people, it was a very ſmall ſin, and indeed interpreters juſtifie the fact, in it ſelf it was no ſin for a King to number his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; yet there were ſome circumſtances with which this fact was cloathed, that made <hi>Davids</hi> fact very notorious: there were ſix hainous aggravations in that fact of <hi>Davids</hi> numbring the people.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all, there was pride and vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory: this <hi>Toſtaius</hi> ſaith, that the ſin of pride and vain glory was <hi>Davids</hi> ſin.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There was carnall depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in his ſin, he would number his people, that ſeeing how ſtrong he was, he might depend on the multitude, that ſaith <hi>Zanchius</hi> was <hi>Davids</hi> ſin too.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, There was covetouſneſſe in the ſin too, <hi>Zanchius</hi> ſaith this was <hi>Davids</hi> ſin. It is obſervable that when in Iſrael the ſouldiers were muſtered, and the ſubjects numbred, there was a tax by pole, that every one ſhould pay to the King this was <hi>Davids</hi> ſin that he would needleſly num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the people for this ſame ſake.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, There was curioſity, for <hi>David</hi> did a needleſſe act; for what need <hi>David</hi> know every particular man in his kingdome in ſo vaſt a confine as <hi>Judah</hi> was? I <hi>Chron</hi> 23. As if he ſhould have ſaid, If there were civill wars among you, or rebelling in thy kingdome, then to know the number of thy ſubjects it were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:122181:75"/>but now what need we? we are all true and loyall to thee: yet vain curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity made <hi>David</hi> do it.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, There was the ſin of ſacriledge, this <hi>Zanchius</hi> notes: for when the people were numbred, there was to be given for the uſe of the Sanctuary, half a ſhekel, as you have the ſtory, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.12. <hi>When thou takeſt the ſum of the children of Iſrael, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their number, then ſhall they give every man a ranſome for his ſoul unto the Lord, when thou numbreſt them, that there be no plague amongſt them, when thou numbreſt them.</hi> Verſ. 13. <hi>This they ſhall give, every one that paſſeth among them that are numbred: half a ſhekel after the ſhekel of the Sanctuary:</hi> compare this with <hi>Exod.</hi> 38.25. <hi>And the ſilver of them that were numbred of the Congregation, was an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred talents, and a thouſand ſeven hundred and threeſcore and fifteen ſhekels after the ſhekel of the Sanctuary, &amp;c. David</hi> did defraud the Sanctuary of that money.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, In this ſin, there was an expreſs breach of Gods Law: this <hi>Deodat</hi> ſaith: for his Law was, the people ſhould not be numbred that were under 20 years, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoſe above 20; now <hi>David</hi> did number thoſe that were under 20. years. <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.14. <hi>Every one that paſſeth among them that are numbred, from</hi> 20 <hi>years old and above, ſhall give an offering unto the Lord. Numb.</hi> 1.3. <hi>From</hi> 20 <hi>years old and upward, all that are
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:122181:76"/>able to goe forth to warre in Iſrael:</hi> Now <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> numbring thoſe that were under thoſe years, did tranſgreſſe the command of God. That is a third conſideration to you that ſay you never run into ſcandalous ſins: yet conſider, that little ſins may be ſo aggravated by circumſtances as that they become grievous: ſuppoſe thy ſin be ſecret luſt, and ſecret paſſion, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret pride: beloved, thy ſins may have ſuch circumſtances, as to make them great: ſuppoſe thy ſins be againſt checks of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience they are great ſins, becauſe they are againſt Gods officer in man; Conſcience is Gods officer in thee, and Gods Regiſter, and Vicegerent in man; and for thee to controll thine own conſcience againſt the accuſations, and againſt the convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and checks of thy conſcience, though the ſin be but a ſmall trifle, yet is it very great; He that doubteth, is damned if he eats. The Apoſtle ſaith it is no ſin to eat meat, but if thou thinkeſt it is a ſin to eat meat, and doſt it, thou ſinneſt againſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. If thy conſcience telleth thee that it is unlawfull to do this or that, and yet thou wilt venture on it, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>He that doubteth is damned, if he eats.</hi> If thou doeſt any thing againſt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes of conſcience, it is a great crime; becauſe conſcience is Gods Officer in thee: to eat meat, is but a trifle; the Queſtion
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:122181:76"/>was, whether they might eat meat offered to an idoll, the Apoſtle ſaith they might do it. I, but ſuppoſe conſcience in a man might ſay, I am perſwaded that if I ſhould eat this meat that was offered to an idoll, I ſhould approve of Idolatry, <hi>then,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>thou art damned if thou eat:</hi> to ſhew, that if in ſo ſmall a thing as eating fleſh, then in other matters alſo; if thy conſcience telleth thee, that thou ſinneſt if thou doeſt it, and yet doeſt it, thy little ſin is become a great ſin.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The ſmalleſt ſin may be ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated, if there be a complacency in thy heart to a ſmall ſin. Beloved, a ſmall ſin that is indulged, is a more aggravating ſin then a greater ſin thou doeſt fall into with reſiſtance. It is very obſervable in <hi>Lev.</hi> 13.12. <hi>And if a leproſie break out abroad in the skin, and the leproſie cover all the skin of him that hath the plague, from his head even unto his foot, whereſoever the Prieſt looketh. Ainſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> admires and wonders what God intends by this Law: the meaning is, the Leproſie betokens ſinne. Now if the leproſie, or the plague, or the ſmall pox; if it comes out into a ſcab, and comes into the fleſh, and ſtrikes out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, there is no diſeaſe within; but then there is danger when ſores ſtrike in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and do not come out in the fleſh: this Law hath this uſe in it, if the lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:122181:77"/>were only on the skin, the man was not unclean, though there was ſin in his life, yet ſin was not in his heart: I, but ſaith God, <hi>if the ſcab be in ſight deeper then the skins then pronounce him unclean,</hi> to ſhew, if ſin be in thy heart and in thy life too, though it be but a ſmall ſin, yet it is a ſin that will damn thee: <hi>If I regard iniquity in my heart, Pſal.</hi> 66.18. <hi>the Lord will not hear me.</hi> Therefore you that are morall men, that ſay, you thank God, that you have not broke out into groſſe ſins: conſider, though ſin be ſmall, yet your ſmall ſins may have ſuch circumſtances, as may make them very great: ſinning againſt your conſciences, or elſe ſin ſeiſing upon the heart.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, to morall men, that a great and groſſe ſinner may be pardoned, when morall men who never brake out into ſuch groſſe wickedneſſe, may live and dye in an unpardoned eſtate. I will give you but two inſtances, the one of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee, and the other of the young man in the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>Firſt, of the Phariſee, in <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. <hi>I thank God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I am no extortioner, no drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, no adulterer;</hi> I am not this nor that: the Phariſee was a man that never broke out into ſcandalous ſins; what was the concluſion? ſaith Chriſt, <hi>that he that juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied himſelf, was not juſtified; but the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:122181:77"/>was juſtified rather then the Phariſee:</hi> the Publican that had fallen into extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his office did expoſe him unto much extortion, which was in alluſion to our Cuſtome-houſe, he was a wicked liver, and yet went away juſtified. O! a civill honeſt Phariſee, a Phariſee that never brake out into ſcandall, yet was not juſtified: a Publican that was a known and infamous ſinner, went away juſtified.</p>
            <p>The prodigall ſonne that ran away from his father, ſpent all his ſubſtance, that is, his gifts, and went to live among hogs and ſwine, in this world, that is, wicked men, yet this man a pardoned man. The young man who tels you that he kept all Gods Commands from his youth, an unjuſtified man: yet the Prodigall that was riotous from his youth, became to be a juſtified man. I am perſwaded, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry intent of theſe Scriptures, is for this end; that civill morall men ſhould not preſume on pardon, meerly on their civill morality.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly conſider, That what your ſins do want in regard of other mens ſins in bulk and magnitude, you may make up in number. Suppoſe thou haſt not been a drunkard, an adulterer, an oppreſſor, yet thou haſt many ſmall ſins, thou haſt many ſecret and ſmall failings: now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, many ſmall ſins may ſooner
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:122181:78"/>damn thee, then a few greater ſins: I may make uſe of that pertinent Scripture, in <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Wherefore a Lion out of the foreſt ſhall ſlay them, and a Wolfe of the evenings ſhall ſpoil them; a Leopard ſhall watch over their cities, every one that goeth out hence ſhall be torn in pieces, becauſe their tranſgreſſions are many, and their back-ſlidings are encreaſed.</hi> Verſ. 7. <hi>How ſhall I pardon thee for this? &amp;c.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their tranſgreſſions were many, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God comes with a queſtion, <hi>How ſhall I pardon?</hi> Beloved, ſuppoſe thy ſins be not great, yet if they be many ſmall ſins, God may put this queſtion to you, How ſhall I pardon you? Let me tell you a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox, That ſmall ſins are as hardly, yea, more hardly pardoned, then greater ſins are. And the reaſon is, becauſe a man is not ſo apt to repent for ſmall ſins, as he will be for great, becauſe they are not ſo viſible, and therefore conſcience not ſo apt to do its office to put a man upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; that is the reaſon of Chriſts ſpeech, <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, that Publicans and harlots ſhall goe to heaven before them,</hi> why? becauſe the Phariſees did depend upon their righteouſneſſe, and did not ſee their little ſmall ſins: a Publican, a harlot, that could not but by the light of nature ſee their extortion, their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and harlotry, they ſhould go to heaven before them, that Chriſt ſhould
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:122181:78"/>tell them of their ſins and they repent of them. Therefore though your ſins be but ſmall, yet they may be many, and that will greaten your ſins: a many ſmall ſins may run thee into deeper arrearages unto God, then a few groſſer evils. O then let me perſwade you, that none of you would preſume on pardon, becauſe you have not fallen into greater and groſſer evils. Thus much for the firſt branch of the Uſe.</p>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, Conſider, though your groſſe ſins cannot bring your perſons into a ſtate of damnation, yet they wil bring you into a ſtate of ſequeſtration; though they cannot keep thee from heaven, yet will they keep thee from comfort: God will ſuſpend and withdraw the manifeſtations of his grace; he will turn his ſmiles into frowns upon thee. Beloved this is ſad, a groſſe ſin will keep thee from the comforts and joyes of heaven, though it cannot keep thee from the poſſeſſion of heaven.</p>
            <p>The Leper in the Law was commanded to be ſhut up out of his own houſe, yet
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:122181:79"/>he had a right to his own houſe; thou mayeſt have a right to heaven, a right to ſalvation, yet God may ſhut thee up that thou mayeſt not have the manifeſtations of a reconciled God towards thee: this is aſtoniſhment to thee.</p>
            <p>

Beloved, if you fall into groſſe ſins, and repell the ſanctifying work of the Spirit, God will withdraw the comforting work of the Spirit. The ſpirit of God is compared to a Dove; the Dove loves to be in clean places, but if the houſe be naſty, the Dove goeth away, and will not ſtay there: Gods Spirit is like a Dove, it loves to have the houſe of thy ſoul kept clean; but if thy ſoul be filled with noyſome and naſty luſts, the Spirit of God will not deſcend on thee; the greater thy ſins are, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thy ſorrowes, anguiſh, and tortures of thy conſcience will be. Philoſophers ſay of evaporation, the more vapours are drawn from the earth, the more the light and luſtre of the Sun is eclipſed: the more ſin doth ariſe from thy heart to thy life, the more thou darkeneſt the riſing of the Sun of righteouſneſſe, that glorious beams ſhall not reflect on thee: thy fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

If I do ſpeak to a troubled conſcience, there is none in the world will ſay, that the ſweetneſſe and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſin, can compenſate the anguiſhand torture of conſcience which ſmarteth for ſinne.</p>
            <p>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Haſt thou fallen into any groſſe and aggravated guilt? follow this Rule, Labour that the greater thy ſin and thy unkindneſſe hath been to God, thou expreſſe now the greater love to Jeſus Chriſt for pardoning mercy: O labour thou that haſt great ſins pardoned, that thou mayeſt have great love iſſued out to Jeſus Chriſt; Chriſt did not ſimply aske <hi>Peter, Simon Peter loveſt thou me?</hi> but go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth higher, <hi>Peter doeſt thou love me more then theſe?</hi> there was this reaſon why Chriſt
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:122181:81"/>ſhould aske him this Queſtion, becauſe <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> had finned againſt Chriſt more then all the diſciples had, therefore <hi>Peter</hi> muſt love Chriſt more.</p>
            <p>Do I ſpeak to any that have been taller by the head in ſin, then any of their neighbours have been? O! if thou haſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned much, love much; the greater the ſin, the greater the pardon muſt be, and therefore on thy part the greater muſt thy love be to Jeſus Chriſt; this is held out plain in that familiar parable that Chriſt uſeth, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.41. <hi>There was a certain credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, which had two debtors, the one ought five hundred pence, and the other fifty.</hi> Verſ. 42. <hi>And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both; Tell me therefore, which of them will love him moſt.</hi> Verſ. 43. Simon <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered and ſaid, I ſuppoſe that he to whom he forgave moſt: And he ſaid unto him, Thou haſt rightly judged.</hi> The meaning of this is, the two debtors are two ſorts of ſinners, he that owed a little ſum he could not pay his debt: though thou haſt but few little ſins, yet thou canſt not ſatisfie for it. He that owed much was a great ſinner, as <hi>Mary Magdalen:</hi> It may be God hath forgiven thee thy hundred of ſins, and thy five hundred of ſins: O make good this Parable, that he that hath moſt forgiven him, love moſt; the greater thy ſin hath been, the greater thy love muſt be. It is thus
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:122181:81"/>with <hi>Mary Magdalen, Luk.</hi> 7.47. <hi>Wherefore I ſay unto thee, Her ſins which are many are forgiven her, for ſhe loved much.</hi> Her love doth hold equipage and proportion to her pardon; much pardon on Chriſts part, and much love on her part. O be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved let me here inculcate this on your thoughts: have any of you been great ſinners? have you been guilty of aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated and hainous circumſtances? now finde that your love doth carry ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to your pardon.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, Hath God ſuffered thee to fall into the iniquity of ſin? obſerve this direction, the greater thy ſin hath been to God, labour that thy humiliation may be greater, that it may carry ſome proportion to the greatneſſe of thy tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion. It is obſervable of what you read of three men in Scripture, of <hi>David, Manaſſes,</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> theſe all ſinned great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and their ſorrow and lamentation did carry proportion to their ſin, in ſome meaſure; <hi>Manaſſes</hi> ſinned greatly, and the ſcripture ſaith of him, that he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himſelf greatly before the Lord. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> did deny Chriſt ſhamefully, and <hi>Peter</hi> went out and wept bitterly. You know <hi>David</hi> ſinned notoriouſly, and he mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned exceedingly, <hi>rivers of tears ran from his eyes, he watered his couch with tears:</hi> all this teacheth you, that the greater thy ſinne
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:122181:82"/>hath been, the greater thy humiliation ſhould be. An obſervable Law, that you read of in <hi>Levit.</hi> 11.24, 25. <hi>And for theſe yee ſhall be unclean, whoſoever toucheth the carkaſſe of them, ſhall be unclean untill the Even. And whoſoever beareth ought of the carkaſſe of them ſhall waſh his clothes, and be unclean untill the Even.</hi> Beloved, touching an unclean thing, a man was unclean all night; but if a man carried an unclean thing any length of time, then ſaith God he ſhall be <hi>unclean till Even,</hi> and he <hi>ſhall waſh his clothes.</hi> This law ſhews, that touching an unclean ſin, requires a humiliation; but if thou haſt toucht a ſin, born a ſin, and hugged a ſin in thine armes, then there is greater work required of thee, he was to waſh his clothes, O thou muſt waſh thy heart by humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, thou muſt take more pains with thy heart, that haſt fallen into a groſs evil, then other men ſhould doe.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourth Direction, In caſe thou expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteſt to have a high eſteeme of pardoning grace, labour thou to find out all the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated and haynous circumſtances in thy ſin. Beloved, doe not fear that the ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſinfulneſſe of ſin will doe you hurt: firſt look on pardon, and then look on the aggravation of thy ſin; this is the way to heighten Chriſts merits, and greaten Gods mercy, and extoll Gods pardoning grace. It is notably mentioned
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:122181:82"/>of two men that were famous this way, It is reported of <hi>Euſebius</hi> a holy and a tender conſcientious man, when he came to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe ſin, he uſed theſe words, <hi>Lord there is none have ſinned, as I have ſinned, the Devill ſinned, Judas ſinned grievouſly, but none ſinned as I:</hi> The Divell indeed ſinned, but Chriſt never dyed for the Devill as hee dyed for me, therefore my ſin is a greater ſin then the Devils; <hi>Judas</hi> ſinned greatly, but <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> never had the pardon I had; <hi>Achan</hi> ſinned too, but I ſinned further then hee.

Firſt, I rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an Orchard meerly out of vanity, not out of need, to ſteal for need is more tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, though not juſtifiable; but when he had enough, that was vanity; then it was not for the goodneſſe of the fruit, but meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the luſt of the eye: then I did not rob the Orchard alone, but I got others with me; then, it was an unſeaſonable time of night; then, he went to rob the Orchard after he had ſpent all the day in vain ſport,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:122181:83"/>then, what they could not eat they gave to the hogs; then, ſaith he, I wronged and injured an honeſt neighbour that never did me wrong: O ſee how he clothed that ſin with many hainous crimes and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, canſt not thou cloath thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uncleanneſſe, thy oppreſſion, thy extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thy unjuſt dealing, with hainous circumſtances? Let me direct you a little in this rule.</p>
            <p>Firſt, To aggravate thy ſin, conſider all ſins againſt the manifeſtation of Gods love are great, when God ſpeaks peace to thee, if thou ſhouldeſt then warre againſt God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58. this greatens ſin, it was an aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of <hi>Solomons</hi> ſin, that he ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lord after God had revealed himſelf twice to him, 1 <hi>King</hi> 11.9. <hi>And the Lord was angry with Solomon, becauſe his heart was turned from the Lord God of Iſrael, which had appeared to him twice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, It aggravates ſin, when you commit a ſin upon a ſlight temptation, for a man to ſin when he hath little or no provocation, that greatens ſin; What made the ſin of the devill ſo great? it was this, that the Angels had no Devils to tempt them: for thee to follow the ſtews, for thee to follow thy luſt when the devill doth not tempt thee to doe it, when the provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is meerly from thine owne heart, this greatens a mans ſin; and thus in the

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Take this for thy comfort, that Jeſus Chriſt, doth manifeſt more love to thoſe men who have fallen into groſſe ſin, after repentance and humiliation, then he did to any other ſorts of men in the world; It is obſervable of <hi>Peter, Peter</hi> did ſin more then all the Diſciples, unleſſe <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> that was the caſt-away, after <hi>Peter</hi> did humble himſelf and repent of his denyall, Chriſt did ſhew more love to <hi>Peter</hi> then to all the other Diſciples.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Chriſt appeared to <hi>Peter</hi> after his Reſurrection, before he appeared to any other, ſo <hi>Paul</hi> tels you in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.5. <hi>And that he was ſeen of Cephas, and then of the twelve,</hi> there was love in Chriſt, <hi>Peter</hi> did deny him but three dayes before, and <hi>Peter</hi> muſt firſt ſee him.</p>
            <p>Again, When Chriſt was riſen from the dead, he ſent a meſſenger to <hi>Peter</hi> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly by name, <hi>Goe tell my Diſciples in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and tell Peter that I am riſen. Mark.</hi> 16.7. <hi>But goe your wayes, tell his Diſciples and Peter. Peter</hi> was crying, weeping and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayling that he ſhould deny his Maſter, and ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Goe tell Peter that I am riſen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Chriſt doth ſingle out <hi>Peter</hi> after hee
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:122181:85"/>roſe from the dead, Chriſt hath more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with <hi>Peter</hi> then he hath with all his Diſciples elſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 21. Thus you ſee that Jeſus Chriſt manifeſts love to thoſe ſinners that ſinned foully, after they have repented and are ſufficiently humbled for their ſin. Thus it is with <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> after ſhee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented, what expreſſions of love doth Chriſt ſhew to her? Firſt, we read that he caſt out of her ſeven Devils, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.2. <hi>And certain women which had been healed of evill ſpirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalen, out of whom went ſeven Divels.</hi> Then he appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed firſt to <hi>Mary,</hi> ſhe was the firſt that ſaw him when he was riſen: <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.9. <hi>Now when Jeſus was riſen early the firſt day of the week, he appeared firſt to Mary Magdalen.</hi> Again, Chriſt wept to ſee <hi>Mary, John</hi> 11.33. <hi>When Jeſus therefore ſaw her weeping, and the Jews alſo weeping which came with her, he groaned in the ſpirit, and was troubled.</hi> Again, Chriſt commanded, that where ever the Goſpell came to be preacht, the fame of <hi>Mary</hi> ſhould be made known, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.13. <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, whereſoever this Goſpell ſhall be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the whole world, there ſhall alſo this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memoriall of her;</hi> What a great honour was this to <hi>Mary Magdalen?</hi> Thus it appears that God doth manifeſt to thoſe perſons that have ſinned the groſſeſt ſins, if afterward they ſhall have the more ſerious, and through
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:122181:86"/>humiliation, the cleareſt evidences, and the ſtrongeſt comforts.</p>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, Take this for your comfort, It is not the greatneſſe of that ſin thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteſt, but onely the hardneſſe and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency of thine owne heart that can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt thee from pardon. Divines doe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſay, that the reaſon of that ſaying in Scripture, <hi>All ſin and blaſphemy ſhall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, but the blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt ſhall not be forgiven, neither in this world nor in the world to come.</hi> It is not that there is not more merit in Chriſt to ſave then there is guilt in that ſin; but it is becauſe that man cannot repent of the ſin; Therefore that ſin cannot be forgiven, becauſe he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not repent. Suppoſe thy ſin be blaſphemy, this doth not exempt from pardon. It is not the greatneſſe of thy ſin, but the Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall hardneſſe and finall impenitency of thy heart, that can exempt thee from pardon. When <hi>Peter</hi> preached to the Jewes that had a hand in crucifying the Sonne of God; yet ſaith he, <hi>Repent, and your ſinnes ſhall he blotted out,</hi> O what ſin could bee greater then their embrewing their hands in the bloud of Chriſt, yet doe but <hi>repent and your ſins ſhall be blotted out.</hi> It is not for want of great mercy on Gods part, and great merits on Chriſts part that men are unpardoned; but it is want of repentance on thine own part.</p>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, That no groſſe ſin committed by a juſtified perſon can make void his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer pardon; A rule among the Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; The work of God cannot be made void or fruſtrated by the work of man, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection is a work of God, Redemption the work of God, Juſtification the worke of God, which cannot be made void by the work of man; therefore if God hath ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted thee, redeemed thee, juſtified and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned thee, the incurſion of groſſe evills cannot reſtrain thee of former pardon; It is true, ſinne may make void thy former comforts, thy former evidences; groſſe ſins may lay waſt thy Conſcience; but they cannot lay waſt the grace and the mercies of God; herein you may be greatly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted and eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, Take this for thy comfort, though thou doſt fall into groſſe and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated guilt, yet ſuch is the goodneſſe and mercy of God; that he orders thy very falling into ſin to turn to thy good. I doe not mention this to any that they ſhould be emboldened to fall into ſin becauſe it may turn to good; O it is God that orders a mans fal for his good: A threefold good that God doth to his people out of their very ſins, God doth not only do good to his people by their afflictions, but he doth good to his people by their very ſins.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Sometimes God doth ſo order
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:122181:87"/>that the falling of a godly man into ſin, ſhall abate pride in his heart; men of great parts are apt to be proud, God many times will let ſtrong luſts attend ſtrong gifts, the more to abate and keep under the exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſpirit, therefore ſaith <hi>Paul, I have the meſſengers of Satan to buffet me, that I might not be exalted above meaſure,</hi> God doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times to keep under pride, let a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation looſe on a man, and ſo God doth him good that way. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, I am not afraid to ſay, that it is profitable ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for good men to fall into ſin.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It will prevent many other ſins; here is Gods great mercy, the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a man to pain takes away pain; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, God ſometimes ſuffers a man to ſin, that that ſin might keep out another ſin; one ſin may be ſo ordered by God to keep out another ſin.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Falling into ſinne ſometimes doth renew the work of repentance, the Lord ſometimes lets them ſleep, that ſo hee might awaken them by a greater humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to taſt the more of the bitterneſſe and the fruite of ſin; here then is Gods goodneſſe to a ſinner, that by letting him fall into a ſin hee doth thee good, and makes thee to renew repentance, and greatens hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation in thy heart.</p>
            <p>Now for the finiſhing of this ſubject,
<note place="margin">Caſes of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> there are 7. Caſes of Conſcience that in this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine are needfull to be reſolved.</p>
            <pb n="157" facs="tcp:122181:87"/>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, Whether God may forgive a man his ſin, and yet the man himſelf not know it: here <hi>David</hi> had ſin forgiven him, and <hi>David</hi> did know it, <hi>I acknowledge, and thou forgaveſt:</hi> but whether may a man have ſin forgiven him, and yet not know he is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned? I anſwer, in the affirmative, that a man may have ſin forgiven him, and yet not know that his ſin is pardoned; though <hi>David</hi> did know his pardon in this Pſalm, yet he did not know his pardon in other Pſalms, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. <hi>Reſtore unto me the joy of thy Salvation.</hi> God broke <hi>Davids</hi> bones for his Adultery, and <hi>David</hi> was driven to ſhed a River of tears before God did pour in one drop of joy: <hi>Job,</hi> 33.10. <hi>Behold, hee findeth occaſions againſt me, he counteth me for his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Job</hi> thought that God was an enemy unto him: and you have not only the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of one man, but the doubts and fears of the Church in generall, <hi>Lament.</hi> 3.42. <hi>We have tranſgreſſed and have rebelled, thou haſt not pardoned, we have rebelled, &amp;c.</hi> Yet God had pardoned, and God had forgiven them; yet here was their fear and their doubt, they lay under ſuſpenſe of pardon; God may pardon a ſin unto the Elect, and yet they not know that they are pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and in the manifold Wiſdom of God there are divers reaſons for it, firſt by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them under a ſuſpenſe of pardon, they may ſympathize with, and carry more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:122181:88"/>of compaſſion towards them that are troubled in minde, it was one end of Chriſts ſufferings, his Soul was in an ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and under a deſertion, crying, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> what was the end of it? it was for this, that Chriſt might carry more compaſſion, and more bowels of tenderneſſe towards perſons that are under deep deſertions; Let a ſcholar that ſtudies many things, read in a Booke the Art of Navigation, and where are rocks and ſhelves, and ſands; yet by all he reads he cannot pity men in a ſtorm, if he have never been in a ſtorm himſelf; lot one read what the Scripture mentions of the pangs of a woman in travell, ſhe cannot ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate a woman in travell, unleſſe ſhe have had the pangs herſelf; ſo in Divine things, it is experience that makes men have compaſſion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is for this reaſon, to raiſe up in mens hearts a higher eſteem of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning grace; things highly come by, are highly ſet by; What is the reaſon that birds doe chirp and ſing more ſweetly in the ſpring then in any other part of the year? it is for this, becauſe after the vaniſhing away of a long and tedious winter the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing Spring comes in: Beloved, The Lord makes his people chirp and ſing in the ſenſe of pardoning grace, rejoycing in that the more, the longer the winter of
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:122181:88"/>deſertion hath bee: when God lets them have long deſertion, then they do the more rejoyce and ſing when pardons are attain'd: Men do then prize the Land, when they have been toſſed by a tempeſt on the ſea. Thoſe that have been toſſed on the waves of ſpirituall trouble, that have had a ſtorm and a tempeſt in their conſciences, they will prize pardoning grace moſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, God doth ſometimes pardon a mans ſin, yet not tell him of it; and it is for rebuke to him, becauſe he hath not lived in the exerciſe of grace: thou kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt back obedience from God, and God keeps back comfort from thee: this is a main reaſon why ſometimes God par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons a ſinner, and yet doth not tell him of it in his own conſcience. It is done in heaven, the pardon is written there; but it is not done in the conſcience, it is not written here: It is to give thee a rebuke, a check in thine own heart; ſurely I have not exerciſed grace, therefore ſurely God will not give me the comforting work of his Spirit: when thou art not much in grace, then thou ſhalt be but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in peace, it is juſt with God ſo to doe.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Lord pardons a ſin when he doth not tell that it is pardoned; it is to make the repentance of men more
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:122181:89"/>viſible and ſatisfactory to the world that hath been offended by their ſin. The Lord will make the world ſee that if men will ſin notoriouſly they ſhall ſmart bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly, to make the world ſee that repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is no ſlight work, and to make peace with God, is not eaſie.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, To make men to taſte the evils and bitterneſſe of ſin: ſhould a man that is notoriouſly wicked, preſently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the ſenſe of pardon, it may be he would not taſte the bitterneſſe of ſin.</p>
            <p>Another reaſon is this, to teach doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Chriſtians that aſſurance is not eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall to pardon, it is ſeparable from pardon, it is ſeparable from faith, therefore from pardon. A man may beleeve, yet know not that he doth beleeve: the Lord doth it for that end, to teach doubting Chriſtians, that though they have not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, yet they may have faith; though they want the ſenſe of pardon, they may be pardoned: there cannot be fruit, but there muſt be a tree; yet there may be a tree, when there is no fruit; there may be grace in the heart, when there is no peace in the conſcience; to have peace is additionall to grace: now the Lord for theſe holy ends doth ſometimes par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don a ſin in heaven, when the pardon is not ſealed to the conſcience. Thus much for the firſt Caſe.</p>
            <pb n="161" facs="tcp:122181:89"/>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> A ſecond Caſe of conſcience is this, If God pardons a ſin, whether or no doth he afflict and puniſh men for it after it is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given? this is an uſefull queſtion: and the reaſon is, becauſe there are errors and miſtakes about it; miſtakes on the right hand and on the left. The <hi>Antinomians</hi> ſay that a pardoned ſinner is never afflicted for ſin; and ſay they, to ſay that a man whoſe ſin is forgiven is afflicted for ſin, doth derogate from the ſatisfaction and ſufferings of Chriſt. Then the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſay, that men are afflicted and puniſhed for ſin, and that theſe puniſhments are for ſatisfaction to Divine Juſtice, and they are meritorious: and on this ground they bottome Purgatory, That after a man is dead, he muſt for ſome years lye in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, to ſatisfie for ſome notorious groſſe ſin done in his life.</p>
            <p>Now beloved to keep you from ſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving either way, I ſhall lay down the true genuine ſtate of this Queſtion, and reſolve it to you.</p>
            <p>Firſt conſider this, That God doth not afflict any man, but where ſin is, that is my firſt poſition. God doth not cruciate an innocent creature: indeed the Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have a queſtion, whether God by his ſoveraignty may torment an innocent creature; but that is but a nicety; but this is moſt certain, that God in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:122181:90"/>of his Judgements doth puniſh no man, but where ſin is, <hi>ſin entred into the world, and death by ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Though God afflicts none ſinleſſe, yet ſometimes it may be for tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and not for ſin; ſo was <hi>Jobs</hi> affliction, it was not for ſin, but for tryall, to try <hi>Jobs</hi> grace.</p>
            <p>Thirdly and chiefly, It is apparent from the Scriptures, that pardoned ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners may be puniſhed for their ſins. Would not this be partiall for a father to beat the ſervant for a fault, yet not beat the childe for a worſe fault? Now beloved, the Lord will not leave ſuch a plea as this in any wicked mans heart. In all the kingdomes of the world, where ſword, where peſtilence, where famine, and where plagues have been, the good have fallen with the bad; the righteous have fallen by the ſword, as well as the wicked: the reaſon is, that the world ſhall not ſay that he is a partiall God. Now to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and to eſtabliſh your thoughts in this point, I ſhall give you two expreſſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies in the Scripture, that God doth puniſh his people for ſin, though their ſins be pardoned. The one is of <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.14. <hi>Howbeit, becauſe by this deed thou haſt given great occaſion to the enemies of the Lord to blaſpheme, the childe alſo that is born unto thee, ſhall ſurely dye.</hi> I will puniſh
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:122181:90"/>thee in thy child, I will pardon thy ſin, yet I will puniſh thy ſin: ſo likewiſe in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.14, 15. <hi>I will be his father, and he ſhall be my ſon: If he commit iniquity, I will chaſten him with the rod of men, and with the ſtripes of the children of men. But my mercy ſhall not depart away from him, &amp;c.</hi> A pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to <hi>Solomon, I will be his father, and hee ſhall be my ſon:</hi> but, <hi>if he commit iniquity, I will chaſten him with rods.</hi> And the Pſalmiſt, when he quotes this expreſſion, referres it to all the godly, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.31, 32. <hi>If they break my Statutes, and keep not my Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements; then will I viſit their tranſgreſſion with the rod, and their iniquity with ſtripes.</hi> It was not only true of <hi>Solomon,</hi> but it is ſpoken of all the Church, <hi>If they commit iniquity, I will chaſtiſe them with rods.</hi> O beloved, here a <hi>Solomon</hi> may be chaſtned with rods if he commits iniquity: nay, not only one man, but all the Church, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.2. <hi>You onely have I known of all the families of the earth; therefore</hi> I <hi>will pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh you for all your inquities.</hi> If God be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, it is with his own people to make them ſmart for ſin: he may ſpare wicked men, and not puniſh them here, becauſe he hath his hell for them hereafter: but this ſhall be all the hell of a godly man, and all their puniſhment. I, but this is Old Teſtament, and thus the <hi>Antinomians</hi> take off, and evade this Scripture: but
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:122181:91"/>doth God ſo in the New Teſtament? Yes, in the New Teſtament, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.10. <hi>And if Chriſt be in you, the body is dead becauſe of ſin.</hi> He ſpeaks of the beleeving <hi>Romans,</hi> that death on their bodies was becauſe of ſin. And then the Apoſtle ſpeaks to the godly <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.29, 30. <hi>For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himſelf, not diſcerning the Lords body. For this cauſe many are weak and ſickly amongſt you, and many ſleep.</hi> Many godly men were ſick and weak for their prophaning the Lords Supper: and this is under the New Teſtament, that the Apoſtle ſaith, as approving the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous judgement of God, let not us com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit fornication, as ſome of them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>Let not us fall as they fell,</hi> and many of them among the 23 thouſand were good men: the Apoſtle approves of Gods Judgement to be righteous in that Act.</p>
            <p>Only one Objection againſt this.</p>
            <p>Doth not the Scripture ſay, in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53. <hi>That the chaſtiſements of our peace are laid on Chriſt?</hi> now if all thoſe chaſtiſements that were due to us for ſin, were laid on Chriſt, doth not this derogate from Chriſts ſufferings, that he muſt ſuffer for ſin, and that we muſt ſuffer too? doth not this intimate that Chriſts ſufferings were not ſatisfactory?</p>
            <pb n="165" facs="tcp:122181:91"/>
            <p>The Anſwer is eaſie.</p>
            <p>That when we ſay, we ſuffer for ſin, and are puniſhed for ſin, underſtand this, there is a great deal of difference between our ſuffering for ſin and Chriſts; we do not ſuffer for ſin as Chriſt did, becauſe our puniſhments for ſin are not by way of ſatisfaction to Divine Juſtice, but only by way of caſtigation from Divine Juſtice: when God doth puniſh a pardoned man with ſome outward Judgement for ſinne, it is no ſatisfaction, no compenſation: when the text ſaith, <hi>that our chaſtiſements are laid upon Chriſt:</hi> the meaning is, Chriſt ſuffers for ſin by way of ſatisfaction, he appeaſeth Gods wrath, he ſatisfies Gods Juſtice for the ſins that we have done: ſhould we loſe our bloud for a ſinne, ſhould we give the fruit of our body for the ſins of our ſoul, yet this cannot make a compenſation for ſin: therefore it may well conſiſt that God puniſhed Chriſt for our ſins by way of ſatisfaction to his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and may puniſh us by way of caſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
            <p>Now to ratifie &amp; ſatisfie your thoughts the more in this: that though God doth pardon a ſin, yet he will puniſh for a ſin: take ſome Reaſons for it.</p>
            <p>Firſt this, Becauſe wicked men that are puniſhed for ſin, would accuſe God of partiality and in juſtice, ſhould he puniſh
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:122181:92"/>them and not his own people for the ſame ſin: wicked men would account God partiall: but the wicked ſhall ſay, I ſee Gods own people are puniſhed in this life more ſeverely then I am: the Lord doth it to vindicate the impartiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Juſtice, that he will not ſpare ſin where ever he finds it.</p>
            <p>A ſecond Reaſon is, Becauſe God doth command Magiſtrates to execute pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments in this life for ſin even upon good men: therefore if he commands a Magiſtrate to puniſh a good man for his ſin, ſurely he doth approve of it. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a good man ſhould commit adultery, he was to dye for it: ſuppoſe he ſhould commit murder, he was to dye for it; if God did command that poenall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be inflicted on good men in this life, then ſurely he might do it much more himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third caſe of Conſcience is this, Whether doth pardon of ſin, go before faith and repentance, or elſe follow after? I do not ſpeak now of the priority of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but of the priority of time. This is a uſefull queſtion.</p>
            <p>There are many Books in Print, made by ſeverall <hi>Antinomians</hi> that plead for this, that a man is pardoned from all eternity, that before a man beleeves and repents, he is pardoned: which is a falſhood, for to
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:122181:92"/>a beleever the Apoſtle doth confine par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. <hi>Whom God hath ſet forth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o be a propitiation, through faith in his bloud to declare his righteouſneſſe, for the remiſſion of ſins that are paſt, through the forbearance of God.</hi> For ſins that are paſt, thoſe ſins you have committed &amp; have repented of, he gives you pardon for all them. He that confeſſeth and forſaketh his ſin, ſhall find mercy; and he that doth not ſo, ſhall not finde mercy.</p>
            <p>I anſwer affirmatively, That God doth pardon ſin after a man repents &amp; beleeves, not before: and to give you a proof for this: Firſt I ſhal give you the grounds from the Scripture: then abſurdities that would follow if this were not ſo.</p>
            <p>Firſt from the Scripture, Obſerve, that the Scripture doth limit and confine par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to a repenting ſtate, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent ye therefore, and be converted, that your ſins may be blotted out.</hi> No blotting out of ſin without repentance, <hi>repent that your ſins may be blotted out. Act.</hi> 26.18. <hi>To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkneſſe to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveneſſe of ſins, and an inheritance among them which are ſanctified by faith that is in me.</hi> So that till thou beeſt turned from darkneſſe to light, untill thou beeſt turned from Satan to God, thou haſt not received forgiveneſſe of ſins:
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:122181:93"/>mark the antecedent words, <hi>he opens their eyes, &amp;c.</hi> therefore God expreſly doth tye forgiveneſſe of ſin to repentance: and ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9. <hi>If we confeſſe our ſins, he is faithfull and juſt to forgive us our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſſe.</hi> There is is firſt a confeſſion, which takes in repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance before forgiveneſſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is no promiſe in all the Scripture, that God will pardon a ſin before mens repentance for ſin: but there are many promiſes that God will pardon when they do repent, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.14. <hi>Thou ſhalt beat him with the rod, and ſhalt deliver his ſoul from hell. Jer.</hi> 23.8. <hi>And I will cleanſe them from all their iniquity whereby they have ſinned againſt me, and I will pardon all their iniquities whereby they have ſinned, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they have tranſgreſſed againſt me.</hi> Many promiſes, that when men repent of ſin they ſhall have ſin pardoned: but there is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a promiſe that hath any ſhew, that before a man repents he ſhall have par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Scripture doth lay them under a ſtate of wrath and condemnation, till they beleeve and repent: unleſſe ye repent ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh. <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.5. <hi>I tell you, Nay: but except ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh. Epheſ.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Among whom alſo we had our converſation in times poſt, in the luſts of our fleſh, fulfilling the deſires of
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:122181:93"/>the fleſh, and of the minde, and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others,</hi> Verſ. 12. <hi>That at that time ye were without Chriſt, being aliens from the Common-wealth of Iſrael, and ſtrangers from the covenants of promiſe, having no hope, and without God in the world.</hi> No hope of heaven, no hope of pardon in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted eſtate. Now by the ſufferings of Chriſt, we receive pardon; a man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repenting, is a man without Chriſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſurely without pardon. Therefore the <hi>Antinomians</hi> do bolſter men in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſſe: ſaying to a drunkard, go on in drunkenneſſe, for God hath pardoned thee from all eternity: but I ſay, Repent therefore, that your ſins may be blotted out. There are not only theſe expreſſe teſtimonies in Scripture, and reaſons grounded thereupon; but manifold and groſſe abſurdities that would follow if you ſhould deny this truth. This would follow then, that there is no difference between a converted man, and a man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted: and is not this groſſe to ſay ſo much comfort to a man before he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, as one may ſay to him after he is converted?</p>
            <p>Secondly, If a man is pardoned before he beleeves and repents, then this deſtroyes Iuſtification by faith: the Scripture ſaith, <hi>being juſtified by faith we have peace with God.</hi> Now juſtification is nothing elſe but a
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:122181:94"/>pardoning of ſin in Gods gracious act not imputing ſin unto you; when the Scripture ſaith, <hi>I am juſtified by faith,</hi> and the <hi>Antinomian</hi> ſaith, I am juſtified without faith, where lyes the error? Now then to ſay that a man is pardoned before he beleeves and repents, is in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe terms to contradict the Scripture, when the Scripture ſaith, <hi>he is juſtified by faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Antinomians</hi> have this evaſion, ſay they, A man is pardoned before he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves he is actually pardoned; but when he beleeves, then he hath manifeſtation of pardon. On this evaſion, a groſſe error will follow; for by this reaſon ſaith is no more inſtrumentall to juſtification, then as it is declarative to a man that he is juſtified: whereas the Scripture ſaith there is more uſe of ſaith, for ſaith is an inſtrument actually to lay hold on Chriſt for pardon; the grace of love to Chriſt, the grace of humility, the grace of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniall, and the grace of mortification; theſe do evidence and declare a pardoned ſtate as well as ſaith: this is to deſtroy the uſe of faith, that ſaith is of little or no uſe in juſtification.</p>
            <p>Again, another abſurdity will follow, to ſay that a man before he repents is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, it is as much as to ſay, before a man be in Chriſt, he is pardoned: this is
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:122181:94"/>falſe, for without Chriſt there is no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. I might run over many abſurdities that would follow in denying this ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox point.</p>
            <p>There is one ſtrong Objection, which is this:</p>
            <p>Doth not God love a man from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? and doth not the Scripture ſay, that we were choſen in Chriſt before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the world were laid? now God electing of us, or loving of us, is Gods pardoning of us; if God doth love a man before he was born, then ſure God doth pardon a man from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. To argue from Gods love to actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all pardon, is as great an abſurdity, as to argue that God did purpoſe from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to create the world, therefore the world was created. God decrees to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don from all eternity, God executes this decree when thou art converted, God doth manifeſt this, that he hath par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned thee, when he doth give thee the aſſurance of his love. <hi>Antinomians</hi> make only the decree and the manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation, and leave out the execution of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, obſerve this, That when we ſay that God doth love a man from all eternity, you muſt underſtand it, that it is a love in purpoſe; and Divines do give this ſolid and uſefull diſtinction in it,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:122181:95"/>that there is a twofold love in God, there is a love of purpoſe, and a love of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency or delight: the love of purpoſe is in God towards elect men from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that is, a love where God hath a purpoſe in time to do a ſoul good: but a love of complacency and delight in God, is not in God till that object be converted: before converſion, God hath not in thee a love of delight; for there is nothing in thee that God ſhould take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in: At that time ye were children of wrath: God doth not love an elect man with the love of complacency, till he be converted, untill he doth repent and beleeve.</p>
            <p>Another Objection is this:</p>
            <p>Doth not God pardon a man before he beleeves, then what ſay ye of young In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants which cannot repent, you will not be ſo cruell to ſay that all Infants go to hell.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, I am farre from thinking that all Infants go to hell: I beleeve that heaven is as full of Infants as any other rank of years in the world; yet this plea will make nothing for thoſe that plead for juſtification before repenting and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving.</p>
            <p>Firſt, conſider, that there is a great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the ſtate of an Infant, and of men grown to years: the Scripture tels
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:122181:95"/>you, that faith comes by hearing, that is, in men grown to years they muſt get their faith in an ordinary way by hearing the Word preached: but this rule holds not for young Infants, becauſe they are not capable of underſtanding, they wanting the uſe of reaſon, and God expects no more from them then he gives ability: faith comes by hearing, ſaith the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: but ſaith the <hi>Antinomians</hi> what need I hear, what need I pray, for a man may have pardon without all? But conſider, that though children cannot exerciſe faith, yet children may have habituall faith, as Divines ſay, children may have grace ſeminarily, though they cannot have the exerciſe of grace. <hi>Thou canſt not tell,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, how the bones of a childe grow in the womb,</hi> therefore much more how God by a ſtrange and a powerfull manner can implant and impreſſe grace in the heart of a ſucking babe, yet there is grace in elect children: in an elect child there is ſeminall grace, and habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all grace. As there is ſin ſeminall in a childes nature, that before a childe can act ſin, it hath ſin; ſo by the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, you that will deny grace in children, will fall into the <hi>Pelagian</hi> error, that a childe hath no ſin: but a child hath a depraved nature, a nature enclining to ſin; therefore when it comes to years,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:122181:96"/>though it ſhould never ſee a ſin commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, yet would it ſin: a childe cannot act grace, cannot act faith and repentance, that is true, but a childe may have grace habituall; therefore Chriſt took children in his armes and bleſt them, ſurely they muſt be gracious children; therefore children in a ſenſe are pardoned if they beleeve: we know not how to expreſſe their faith, but they do beleeve, they have an habituall faith. And thus much for the anſwering of that third caſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The fourth Caſe to be handled, is this, Whether it be conſiſtent with the ſtate of pardon to commit often the ſame groſſe ſin over and over again, it is needfull to touch upon this caſe, becauſe it perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth troubled mindes.</p>
            <p>Firſt, by way of comfort.</p>
            <p>Firſt anſwer is this, That it is clear by an induction of particular inſtances in Scripture, that pardoned men have fallen often into the ſame ſin, this is moſt clear.</p>
            <p>Firſt, if you referre it to ſpirituall evils, to evils that are of daily incurſion, evils that are inward and ſpiritual, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall pride, diſtempered paſſion, remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in duties; a pardoned man may ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times fall into ſuch ſins as theſe.</p>
            <p>Further it is clear by induction of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in Scripture, that a pardoned man
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:122181:96"/>may fall into groſſe ſins, oftentimes into the ſame ſin: ſome inſtances, one is of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> it was a groſſe ſin for <hi>Joſeph</hi> to ſwear an heath eniſh Oath, by the life of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh, Gen.</hi> 42.15.15. <hi>Hereby ye ſhall be proved, by the life of</hi> Pharaoh <hi>ye ſhall not goe forth hence, except your youngeſt brother come hither. Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye ſhall be kept in priſon, that your words may be proved, whether there be any truth in you: or elſe by the life of</hi> Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh <hi>ſurely ye are ſpies.</hi> Yet the Jewes were ſo well inſtructed, and had ſuch prohibitions againſt ſwearing, one ſhould think that they ſhould not be guilty of ſo groſſe an evill; yet <hi>Joſeph</hi> being in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> court among heathens, he ſwore twice by the life of <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> And thus you read of <hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi> he fell twice into the ſame ſin, he made a league with <hi>Ahali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he loved them that were enemies to God, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.35, 36, 37. <hi>And after this did</hi> Jehoſaphat <hi>King of</hi> Judah <hi>joyn himſelf with</hi> Ahaziah <hi>King of Iſrael, who did very wickedly: And he joyned himſelf with him to make ſhips to go to Tarſhiſh: and they made the ſhips in Ezion-Geber. Then</hi> Eliezer <hi>the ſon of</hi> Dodanah <hi>of Mareſhah propheſied againſt</hi> Jehoſhaphat, <hi>ſaying, Becauſe thou haſt joyned thy ſelf with</hi> Ahaziah, <hi>the Lord hath broken thy works: and the ſhips were broken, that they were not able to go to Tarſhip.</hi> Twice
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:122181:97"/>he ran into the ſame ſin. And then you have it in the caſe of <hi>Solomon,</hi> he fell into Idolatry, and the Text ſaith, that he ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt God after God appeared twice to him. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 11.9. <hi>And the Lord was angry with</hi> Solomon, <hi>becauſe his heart was turned from the Lord God of Iſrael, which had appeared unto him twice.</hi> He fell to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry after God appeared twice to him; ſo that it notes <hi>Solomon</hi> fell oftentimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame ſin. Thus you read of <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pſon,</hi> that Divines call a very compound of vices, <hi>Judg.</hi> 16. If there were no more ſpoken of <hi>Sampſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n</hi> in the New Teſtament, then in the old, it were queſtionable whether he was a good man or no: but what read you of <hi>Sampſon?</hi> You read of him firſt of all <hi>that he marryed a heatheniſh woman,</hi> which was againſt Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. Nay he fell to the ſame ſin when the Philiſtims killed her, then he marryed a whore, chap. 16.1. <hi>Then went</hi> Sampſon <hi>to Gaza, and ſaw there an harlot, and went in unto h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r.</hi> Nay again, you ſhall finde him fall three times into the ſame ſin. Firſt of all, he did three times tell a lye, one after another; when <hi>Dalilah</hi> came to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veagle him on the inſtigation of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtims that ſhe ſhould learn where <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pſons</hi> ſtrength lay: firſt ſaith <hi>Sampſon, If they binde me with ſeven green withs, that were never dryed; then ſhall I be weak, and be as
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:122181:97"/>another man.</hi> But when he was bound, he broke the withs as one would break the thred a two when it toucheth the fire: then ſaith ſhee, why haſt thou deceived me and told me a lye? then he told her again, <hi>If thou wilt binde me with new ropes that were never uſed, then I ſhall be weak like another man:</hi> but he broke the ropes. Nay he tels her a third lye, he ſaid unto her, <hi>If thou weaveſt the ſeven locks of my head with the web, then my ſtrength will go from me,</hi> and this ſhe did alſo, and his ſtrength remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. But the fourth time he told her truth, ſaith he, <hi>If I be ſhaven, then my ſtrength will go from me, and I ſhall become weak, and be like another man:</hi> and ſhe cauſed the ſeven locks upon his head to be ſhaved off, and his ſtrength went from him. I ſpeak this to a perplexed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; that good men may be ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born that they may frequently act over the ſame ſin again and again.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Peter</hi> that did lye thrice as <hi>Sampſon</hi> did, <hi>Peter</hi> did deny Chriſt three times with an oath and a curſing.</p>
            <p>Another inſtance, that is in the caſe of the Iſraelites <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.22. <hi>Becauſe all thoſe men which have ſeen my glory, and my miracles which I did in Egypt, and in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, and have tempted me now theſe ten times, and have not hearkned to my voice.</hi> Therefore this ſhould be ſomething to
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:122181:98"/>ſtay the heart, that not only ſins of an unavoidable infirmity, ſecret ſpirituall ſins, but alſo ſins that are more obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to infamy and ſcandall, goodmen have fallen into, and yet been par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned.</p>
            <p>Another anſwer, That Jeſus Chriſt bids us to forgive our brother that ſins againſt us in one day ſeventy times ſeven: if Jeſus Chriſt cals for this at our hands, who have not hardly a drop of bowels, ſurely God that hath a ſea and a vaſt O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean of mercies, can forgive a ſin, and will forgive a ſin, though it be often reiterated.</p>
            <p>Thus much for anſwer to that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
            <p>Now by way of Caution, that this comfort the Scripture gives be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed.</p>
            <p>Firſt Caution is this, That though it be poſſible a man may fall often into the ſame ſin; yet it is not uſually recorded in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it is a Note that <hi>Hilderſham</hi> hath on <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. touching <hi>Davids</hi> foul ſin. I do not read of any expreſſe example in all the Scriptures of a godly man fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling oft into the ſame groſſe ſins after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and after humiliation for that ſin. Obſerve this further, that though it be poſſible, yet it is but very rare, and though there be inſtances that ſome men have done ſo, yet there are more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:122181:98"/>inſtances that good men have not done ſo, I will give you a few inſtances. <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaphat</hi> entred into a ſinfull league with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haziah</hi> but when the Prophet rebuked him, read the ſtory, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22. He had ſinned once with his father, but he would not ſin a ſecond time with him, ſo that, here you ſee a good man would not a ſecond time join with an <hi>Ahaziah;</hi> So likewiſe you have the inſtance in <hi>Judah,</hi> that was father in law to <hi>Thamar, Gen.</hi> 38.26. <hi>And Judah acknowledged them, and ſaid; She hath been more righteous then I, becauſe that I gave her not to Shelah my ſon, and he knew her again no more.</hi> It was not again done, <hi>he knew her again no more,</hi> ſo as Divines doe uſually urge it; <hi>Noah</hi> was drunk, but never but once, and that before he knew the ſtrength of the grape. <hi>David</hi> was adulterous, but never but once: This therefore ſhall be one caution.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Take this Caution, that you might not be emboldned to run often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame ſin; if a man doth often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the ſame groſſe ſin, it argues a greater ſtrength and prevalency that that ſin hath over him then all other ſins, Phyſitians ſay, that a diſeaſe that a man doth often relapſe into, argues the ſtrength of theſe peccant humours that feed the diſeaſe; if thou often falleſt into luſts, it argues the prevalency of a luſtfull temper.</p>
            <pb n="180" facs="tcp:122181:99"/>
            <p>In the third place, Relapſes into the ſame groſſe ſin, are very dangerous and deadly ſymptomes of a man in a loſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, I doe not ſay, they are ſuch ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes that infallibly conclude a man to be an unpardoned man; I may ſay as Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians ſay of a relapſe into the ſame diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe; the ſecond time is more dangerous then the firſt diſeaſe, the reaſon is, becauſe the firſt ſickneſs feeds on the ill humors; but relapſe into the ſame fickneſſe feeds on the vitall ſpirits: Beloved, the falling and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſing into the ſame ſin is a dangerous ſymptome, it is a clear ſymptome of the prevalency of that ſin. It is worth your notice what ſymptomes the Lord doth give of the plague of leproſie for the Prieſt to judge that diſeaſe by, <hi>Levit.</hi> 13. the firſt ſymptome was when the hair was turned white in the ſore; Divines accommodate that to a continuance in ſin to old age, that argues you are unclean Lepers. Another ſymptome was, when there was raw fleſh in the ſcab; Divines accommodate that unto a man being adventurous to ſin againſt a raw, a troubled, and a wounded Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. A third ſign of the plague of lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie was, when after the ſore was healed there ſhould a new ſcab ariſe in the place thereof: thus when after thou haſt healed a fin, by vows, by faſting and prayer, by holy purpoſes in Chriſts ſtrength, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:122181:99"/>the healing the ſame ſore breaks out, and the ſame luſt breakes in upon thee, this is a dangerous ſymptome.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That you might not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturous on this comfort, conſider, that falling often into the ſame ſin, doth more harden the heart then any thing in the world, habituating and indulging a mans ſelf into the ſame road of wickedneſſe; there is nothing in the world doth more harden the heart then when the ſame ſinne hath the ſame inroad into thy conſcience and life, then all tenderneſſe and remorſe of conſcience will be taken away; I ſpeak meerly on this ground, that ſeeing you have inſtances that men may fall often into the ſame groſſe evils, yet let theſe four con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations keep you from abuſing this comfortable point. I, but you will ſay, if I doe fall often into the ſame ſin, what may be to ſtay my heart up that I may be in a pardoned eſtate for all this? <hi>I</hi> ſay this to you, though thou doſt fall often into the ſame ſin; yet if thy conſcience bears thee witneſſe thou doſt exerciſe the ſame grace often in oppoſition to the ſame ſin, thou mayſt have a great deal of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort that thou art in a ſtate of pardon.</p>
            <p>The fifth caſe follows,</p>
            <p>But whether may a godly man that is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned pray for pardon of ſin? Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans account this to be needleſſe; they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:122181:100"/>all prayer for pardon to be onely in this ſenſe, to wit, for a ſenſe of pardon, and a manifeſtation of pardon. <hi>Anſw.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, Though it be true, that God doth not call a man to pray for thoſe things that are perfectly done ſo as never to bee done again, yet God doth command us to pray for thoſe things that are but imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly done. I am not to pray to God to create the world, it is perfectly done, I am not to pray for Election, it is ſo done as never to be done more. I am not to pray for the incarnation of Chriſt, Chriſt is come into the fleſh, but though I am not to pray for theſe things that are ſo fully and perfectly done; yet I am to pray for thoſe things that are imperfectly done, pardon of ſin is an act of God that is ſtill in doing, therefore the Apoſtle refers par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24, 25. <hi>Being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Christ, Whom God hath ſet forth to bee a propitiation, though Faith in his bloud, to declare his righteouſneſſe for the remiſſion of ſins that are paſt, through the forbearance of God.</hi> And as ſin is remitted and repented of, it is pardoned; therefore that Reaſon is not valid to take off men from praying for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin, the Scripture doth expreſſe it, <hi>I acknowledge my tranſgreſſion and thou forga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt, Matth.</hi> 6.12. <hi>And forgive us our debts as wee forgive our debters.</hi> That Plat-form
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:122181:100"/>according to which we are to model our prayers, the Antinomians would evade the Text and pretend, that in that Text and ſuch Scriptures wee onely pray for a ſenſe and manifeſtation of pardon in the Conſcience, and not for actuall exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of pardon in regard of God.</p>
            <p>To take off this, firſt, The next words in the Petition, are to be taken for a reall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe, not for a forgiveneſſe in ſenſe and feeling; for conſider the whole Petition, <hi>Forgive us our treſpaſſes as wee forgive them that treſpaſſe againſt us;</hi> there can bee no reaſon ſhewed why the firſt part of the Petition ſhould bee taken for ſenſe and feeling of forgiveneſſe, and the other ſhould be taken ſo.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Conſider this, that in the ſame ſenſe you muſt underſtand a ſin to be forgiven, as in Scripture language it is ſpoken not to be forgiven; a ſin is ſaid not to be forgiven when there is an actuall guilt lies upon a man; a guilt redound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the perſon of a wicked man that is taken away, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.32. <hi>And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſpeaketh a word againſt the Son of man, it ſhall bee forgiven him, but whoſoever ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth againſt the Holy Ghoſt, it ſhall not bee forgiven him neither in this world, neither in the world to come.</hi> They that underſtand for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving onely in ſenſe and feeling, muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this clauſe, not forgiving onely
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:122181:101"/>in ſenſe and feeling, and ſo no reall guilt to lye upon the man.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is againſt the nature of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe to be onely forgiving ſinne in a mans own conſcience.</p>
            <p>A ſixt caſe is this, Whether when a man is ſuing for pardon, he ought to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny difference between great ſins and ſmall ſin. The Stoicks ſay all ſins are alike, and there is no difference; It is true, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the object, all ſins are againſt God; yet when you come to beg pardon for ſin, according as your ſinnes are greatned, you are accordingly to behave your ſelves in ſeeking for pardon: God can pardon great ſins as well as ſmall, in regard of God there is no difference, nor in regard of the merits of Chriſt; but yet in your behaviour in ſeeking for pardon of ſinne you are to make a great difference between the greatneſſe and the ſmallneſſe of your evills: For Beloved, Firſt, Conſider the Scripture makes a difference between ſins; therefore we muſt doe ſo, the Scripture compares ſome ſins to Camels, and ſome to Gnats, the Scripture compares ſome ſins to beams, and ſome to motes, ſome ſins as talents, and others but as pence, and in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos</hi> there is mention made of mighty ſins, <hi>Amos</hi> 5. in <hi>John</hi> of greater ſins, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.11. Jeſus anſwered, <hi>Thou couldſt have no power at all againſt me, except it were given thee from
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:122181:101"/>above, therefore hee that delivered me unto thee, hath the greater ſin.</hi> It is true, every ſin deſerves hell, yet there is more of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of hell inflicted on ſome ſinners then others; the reaſon why I ſpeake of this caſe, is to let you know, that as God hath ſuffered any of you to fall into ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated and hainous evils, ſo he requires more of you then of other men. Firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that God requires of you more hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation then he requires of other men; In the Law you read that if a man toucht the unclean thing, he was unclean till Evening, but if a man bare an unclean thing he was to waſh his clothes, to ſhew that the touch of ſin requires hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation; but the bearing of a ſin in thy boſome, thy continuing in ſin requires more work then meerly the touch of ſin; <hi>Peter</hi> wept bitterly for his denyall, he did more for that ſin then for an ordinary ſin. So that you are to conſider, that though in regard of Chriſt there is no difference between a great ſin and a ſmall; as the red Sea could drown <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his hoſt as well as a ſingle man; ſo Chriſts bloud can drown a huge hoſt of ſins; but yet you muſt encreaſe your humiliation on the aggravation of your guilt; thus much for the fixth caſe of Conſcience.</p>
            <p>The ſeaventh is this;</p>
            <p>What are thoſe great and hainous cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:122181:102"/>that doe greaten ſin; that ſo I may ſee whether I have aggravated my ſin or not; here are two circumſtances which doe aggravate and greaten ſin.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Sinning againſt the frequent manifeſtation of Gods love to thy ſoul, this greatly aggravates ſin; this did ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate <hi>Solomons</hi> ſin, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 11. <hi>Solomon</hi> was the Beloved of the Lord, yet he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked him to anger.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To ſin againſt the rebukes and checks of thine own Conſcience, doth greaten ſin, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.17. <hi>Therefore to him that knoweth to doe good, and doth it not, to him it is ſin.</hi> It is ſinne to another man that doth not know it; but to him that knoweth it, it is a greater ſin; this Chriſt refers to and ſpeaks of <hi>Judas</hi> that would betray him; and yet knew that hee was the Son of God; What, my Diſciples to betray me! his ſin was the greater, Conſcience is Gods officer in man; it is a greater fault to ſtrike a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable then an ordinary man out of office; for thee to ſin againſt the rebukes and checks of Conſcience aggravates ſin.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, To ſin againſt Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon other men is an aggravated evill; for thee to ſin when God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thee warning of ſin from other mens bloud; this did aggravate <hi>Belſhazzars</hi> ſin, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.22, 23. <hi>And thou his ſon, O Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhazzar,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:122181:102"/>haſt not humbled thine heart, though thou kneweſt all this. But haſt lifted up thy ſelfe againſt the Lord of heaven, &amp;c.</hi> Thou that knoweſt how a man is plagued for his uncleanneſſe; thou that knoweſt how a man is plagued for riotous living; yet thou wilt live riotous, and thou wilt live adulterous; O thou man thy ſin is the greater, thou ſinneſt againſt the monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the eye, as well as againſt the warning of the ear.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Sin againſt Gods judgments upon our ſelves doth weigh ten ſin; this did aggravate <hi>Ahaz</hi> ſin, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.22. <hi>And in the time of his diſtreſſe he did treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe yet more againſt the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, To ſin againſt mercies is an ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of ſin, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. <hi>I delivered thee out of Sauls hand, I gave thee thy Maſters houſe, I gave thee the houſe of Iſrael, and if all this had been too litttle for thee, I would have moreover given thee ſuch and ſuch things, Wherefore haſt thou deſpiſed, &amp;c?</hi> What thou ſin <hi>David?</hi> and haſt been loadned with a heap of mercies? this greatens thy ſin.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, It greatens ſin, when the ſin is immediately againſt God, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.25. <hi>If one man ſin againſt another, the Judge ſhall judge him; but if a man ſin againſt the Lord, who ſhall entreat for him?</hi> If a man ſins againſt God, O who ſhall plead for him?</p>
            <pb n="188" facs="tcp:122181:103"/>
            <p>Seaventhly, To ſin againſt the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Gods Spirit, aggravates ſin, when the Spirit of God ſhall in thy Conſcience perſwade thee that thou wouldſt not follow ſuch wicked wayes as thou art walking in; when the Spirit of God ſhall come and woo thee to be reconciled, to alter thy courſe and to walk in better paths; when not onely the voice of Conſcience, but the motions of Gods Spirit ſhall be ſtifled; this aggravates ſin: Hence it is that Scripture in ſetting out the wronging and withſtanding the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits motion, whether to good, or from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, doth aſcend by gradations: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is called quenching the Spirit; <hi>Queuch not the Spirit;</hi> a higher degree, there is a grieving the Spirit, when there are frequent acts to withſtand Divine moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that is a grieving the Spirit.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, There is an higher aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then this, that is, reſiſting the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.51. <hi>Ye ſtiffe neeked and uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in heart, and eares, ye doe alwayes reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt, as your Fathers did, ſo doe yee:</hi> This is cauſed by pertinaciouſneſſe in withſtanding the Spirits motion.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Scripture ſpeakes of vexing the Spirit, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.10. <hi>But they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellect and vexed his Holy Spirit, therefore hee was turned to be their enemy, and fought againſt them:</hi> This is not onely by one ſingle act;
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:122181:103"/>but when continually throughout thy courſe, thou haſt a wilfull and a gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying heart againſt all the motions of Gods Spirit within thee: Muſt not this be a great evill in thee, when thou doſt quench, grieve, reſiſt, and vex the Spirit? all theſe circumſtances muſt needes aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and greaten thy ſin.</p>
            <p>Eightly, Sin is aggravated when thou doſt frequently fall into the ſame ſin.</p>
            <p>Ninethly, Sin is aggravated when it is done in a way of complacency, that it is not onely acted by thee, but loved by thee, the acting of a ſin, is not ſo much as a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of ſin.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, ſin is aggravated when it is done by eminent and publick perſons, whoſe example draw other men to ſin, and this did aggravate <hi>Jereboams</hi> ſin, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17.21. <hi>For he rent Iſrael from the houſe of David, and they made Jeroboam the Son of Nebat King, and Jeroboam drave Iſrael from following the Lord, and made them ſin a great ſin.</hi> Thou that haſt ſinned a ſin, and art a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like perſon, thy ſins are other mens ſins, thine is a greater ſin then another mans ſin is; for every act that thou haſt done will be an imboldning and encouragement of other to doe the like.</p>
            <p>Eleventhly, It aggravates ſin, when God doth puniſh other men for thy ſin, this makes the ſins of Rulers to be great ſins,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:122181:104"/>becauſe for their ſins God may puniſh the people, as for <hi>Davids</hi> ſin in numbring the people, there did thouſands of <hi>Iſrael</hi> dye of the plague; when thou ſinneſt in thy family, God may puniſh all the houſe for that ſin; this you ſhall find an aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſin, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.9. <hi>Then Abimelech called Abraham, and ſaid unto him, What haſt thou done unto us, and what have I offended thee, that thou haſt brought on m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e and on my Kingdome a great ſin? thou haſt done deeds unto mee that ought not to be done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Twelfthly, Sin is an aggravated ſin when it is done by a man that lives under much means of grace; where the Goſpel is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, where ſin is reproved, there to live in a way of wickedneſſe, greatens thy ſin, that made a woe to be pronounced by Chriſt, againſt <hi>Chorazin</hi> and againſt <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaida,</hi> becauſe they had the Goſpell, it ſhould be worſe with them then with <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the thirteenth place, Sin is aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, when they are againſt many vows, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, and prayers, and many holy reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, thou addeſt perjury to thine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and that aggravates thy ſin.</p>
            <p>The Uſe; Such are the riches of Gods pardoning grace, that he forgives ſinnes cloathed with many aggravated circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; O then what remains? there are two things to be done by you: Firſt, if
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:122181:104"/>of any you find that you are under theſe thirteen aggravations, that you can call your ſins the iniquity of ſin; O then you ſhould admire and magnifie the multitude of Gods mercy, that great ſins cannot out-vie Gods mercy, but Gods mercy out-vie thy great ſins, Magnifie pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace the more; <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Who was before a blaſphemer, and a perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor, and injurious, but I obtained mercy, &amp;c.</hi> O doe thou ſay ſo, I have been thus vile and thus wicked, I have thus cloathed my ſin, yet through the aboundance of grace and love, I have obtained mercy. O let this inhance the value of Chriſts bloud.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Labour to greaten thine own graces; haſt thou beene notorious in ſin? why ſhouldſt not thou be great in humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, great in repentance?</p>
            <p>And thus I have by the good hand of God in theſe twelve Sermons, handled two Doctrines to you, the one touching <hi>Davids</hi> penitentiall act confeſſing ſin, and the other of Gods gracious act, <hi>The Lord forgave him the iniquity of his ſin.</hi> So much for this Text.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> The firſt Doctrine, That Chriſts Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or going up to Heaven is a ground of comfort and great advantage to all Gods people whilſt they dwell here upon the Earth. In the handling of this poynt there are three particulars. Firſt, I ſhall prove it to you by Scripture, that Chriſt is bodily gone into Heaven I prove it by theſe five Arguments in Scripture.</p>
            <p>Firſt, by the Types that were before the Law, <hi>Enoch</hi> was tranſlated and taken up bodily into Heaven, where now hee is. <hi>Geneſis</hi> 5.24. <hi>verſ. And Enoch walked with God, and he was not, for God tooke him,</hi> this is affirmed by the Apoſtle, <hi>Hebrews</hi> 11.5. <hi>v. By Faith</hi> Enoch <hi>was tranſlated, that he ſhould not ſee death, and was not found, becauſe God had tranſlated him, for before his tranſlation he had this Teſtimony, That he pleaſed God.</hi> And under the Law, <hi>Eliah</hi> was taken up to Heaven in a fiery Chariot, 2 Kings 2.11. <hi>v. And it came to paſſe, as they ſtill went on and talked, that behold, there appeared a Chariot of fire, and Horſes of fire, and parted them both aſunder, and</hi> Eliah <hi>went up by a whirle winde into Heaven.</hi> So Chriſt makes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> third under the Goſpell taken up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven alſo.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:122181:108"/>
            <p>Second Argument to prove this Doctrine, is by prophecies in the old Teſtament that Jeſus Chriſt was to be taken up into heaven bodily, three prophecies, one in the 68. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> there <hi>David</hi> prophecy'd of Chriſt in the 18 <hi>verſ. Thou haſt Aſcended on high, &amp;c.</hi> Now wee ſhould not have known ſo full that this had reference to Jeſus Chriſts Aſcention, if <hi>Paul</hi> had not expounded this, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. and the 14 <hi>verſ. Seeing then that we have a great high Prieſt that is paſſed into the Heavens, Jeſus the Sonne of God, let us hold faſt our profeſſion.</hi> The Prophecies that were long before Chriſt was borne did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare this, that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould aſcend up into Heaven, and in the 110 <hi>Pſalme</hi> the 7. <hi>verſ. Hee ſhall drinke of the Brooke in the way, therefore ſhall be lift up the head;</hi> what is that? It is ſpoken of Chriſt, I will ſee him upon my right hand, firſt he ſhall drinke o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> thirſt upon the Croſſe, hee ſhall die and b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> crucified, then afterwards hee ſhall lift up his head, he ſhall riſe againe and aſcend up into Heaven, a full prophecy in <hi>Daniel</hi> 7.13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 14. <hi>verſ. I ſaw in the night Viſions, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, One like the Sonne of man, came with the Clouds of Heaven, and came to the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of dayes, and they brought him neere before him. And there was given him Dominion and Glory, and a Kingdome, that all People Nations and Languages ſhould ſerve him
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:122181:109"/>his Dominion is an everlaſting Dominion, which ſhall not paſſe away, and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that which ſhall not bee deſtroyed.</hi> This cannot be ſpoken of Chriſts coming to judgement, but then the <hi>Text</hi> ſaith, <hi>he ſhall deliver them to his Father,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. But the coming of Chriſt in the Clouds here, is Chriſts going up into Heaven, as it is in the <hi>Acts</hi> 1. <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. <hi>And when hee had ſpoken theſe things, while they beheld, hee was taken up, and a Cloud received him out of their ſight.</hi> And thus you have it by Prophcies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Doctrine of Chriſts going up to Heaven, is confirmed to you by Chriſts promiſes, Chriſt upon the Earth did promiſe that hee would go up to Heaven, <hi>John</hi> 6 62. <hi>What and if yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man aſcend up where hee was before?</hi> In <hi>Iohn</hi> 20.17. <hi>Ieſus ſaith unto her, Touch me not, for I am not yet aſcended to my Father, but goe to my Brethren and ſay unto them, I aſcend unto my Father, and to your Father, and to my God, and your God.</hi> Chriſt did promiſe that hee would aſcend, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.5, 7. <hi>But now I go my way to him that ſent mee, and none of you asked me, whither goeſt thou?</hi> Nevertheleſſe, I tell you the truth, it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for you that I go away, for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you, but if I depart, I will ſend him unto you. <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.16. <hi>A little while, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:122181:109"/>yee ſhall not ſee mee, and againe a little while, and yee ſhall ſee mee, becauſe I goe to the Father.</hi> I could quote you many Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that Chriſt promiſed hee would goe away.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the Doctrine of Chriſts going up to Heaven is confirmed by the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Apoſtles, who were Eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of Chriſts Aſcenſion. <hi>Gerrard</hi> notes, ſaith he, Jeſus Chriſt did riſe inviſible, none ſaw him Riſe, the Scripture telleth you that the Souldiers that watched were aſleepe, yet Chriſt gathereth all his eleven Apoſtles that they might be Eye witneſſes of his Aſcenſion that they ſaw him aſcend to Heaven, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.9, 10. <hi>And when hee had ſpoken theſe things, while they beheld hee was taken up, and a Cloud received him out of their ſight.</hi> And while they looked ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly towards Heaven, as hee went up, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, two men ſtood by them in white ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, and ſo the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> in the 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 3.22. <hi>Who is gone into Heaven, and is on the right Hand of God, Angells and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and Powers, being ſubject unto him.</hi> So <hi>Paul</hi> tells you in <hi>Epheſians</hi> 4.10. <hi>He that deſcended, is the ſame alſo that aſcended up farre above all Heavens, that hee might fill all things.</hi> So in <hi>Hebrewes</hi> 9. <hi>the Author of that Booke tells you that Jeſus Chriſt is not gone into the holy place, but is gone into the Heaven it ſelfe,</hi> In verſ. 24. <hi>For Christ is not
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:122181:110"/>entred into the Holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true, but into Heaven it ſelfe, now to appeare in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God for us.</hi> 1 Tim. 3.16. <hi>And without controverſy great is the myſtery of Godlineſſe, God was manifeſt in the fleſh, juſtified in the ſpirit, ſeene of Angels preached unto the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, believed on in the World, received up into glory.</hi> And in <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.19. <hi>So then after the Lord had ſpoken unto them, hee was received up into Heaven, and ſate on the right hand of God.</hi> I take the more paines to prove this, becauſe of what Ancient Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies there have been to overthrow this great comfortable Doctrine of Chriſts going bodily into Heaven, having our fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſh in Heaven this very day.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, it may be proved by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current Teſtimonies of the Angells, who were witneſſes of this truth. <hi>Acts</hi> 1.10. <hi>ve. And while they looked ſtedfaſtly toward Heaven, as he went up, behold, two men ſtood by them in white apparell.</hi> Theſe two men were Angells, the Angels did give in their concurrent Teſtimonies that Jeſus Chriſt did goe into Heaven, and the ſame Jeſus Chriſt that did go ſhall come againe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved I know not any one poynt in all the Bible that is ſo proved and ſtrengthned as Chriſts perſonall and Bodily going up to Heaven, and thus much for the ſtrengthning of you in the proofe of the poynt, I lay
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:122181:110"/>that for the Foundation, becauſe if the proof of it be not well grounded, then the fruit of it will not be well regarded.</p>
            <p>Secondly, what is the reaſon that Chriſt muſt have his Body goe up to Heaven, and not his Soul, as other mens?</p>
            <p>Firſt Chriſt in his bodily preſence muſt go to Heaven, leſt his Diſciples ſhould be taken too much with his bodily preſence, and never looke after the Communication of his Spirit. Therefore they aske Chriſt, Lord when wilt thou reſtore the Kingdome to <hi>Iſrael?</hi> they expected that Chriſt would take away the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour which was a heathen, and expected that hee would bee King himſelfe, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.6. <hi>When they therefore were come together, they asked of him ſaying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore againe the Kingdome to Iſrael?</hi> It is for this reaſon ſay Interpreters, becauſe the Diſciples ſhould not dote on Jeſus Chriſt as to looke on him as a temporall King, and looke on him for a temporall Kingdome, ſo that was one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why hee would not leave his body with them, but that they might looke after the Kingdom where he is, therefore <hi>Paul</hi> hath a paſſage in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Wherefore hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth know wee no man after the fleſh, yea, though we have known Chriſt after the fleſh, yet now henceforth, know we him no more.</hi> As if hee ſhould ſay, it may be thoſe that lived in Chriſts time, that knew him accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:122181:111"/>to the fleſh as a lovely perſon, but ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> wee know him in a ſpirituall way, to looke after Heaven by Chriſt, to looke after Salvation by Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Chriſt muſt be taken up into Heaven in his body to make a compenſation and a recompence to himſelfe, for his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings in his Body, to make a compenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to him for his bodily ſufferings, hee muſt go to Heaven, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8.9. <hi>And being found in faſhion as a Man, hee humbled himſelfe, and becauſe obedient unto Death, even the Death of the Croſſe. Wherefore God alſo hath highly exalted him, and given him a Name which is above every Name.</hi> Therefore God did exalt Chriſt and raiſe him from the dead and bring him to Heaven, becauſe hee obeyed the death of the Croſſe, and took on him the forme of a ſervant, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. laſt Verſ. <hi>He ſhall drinke of the brooke in thy way, therefore ſhall hee lift up the Head.</hi> Becauſe thou dyedſt and ſufferedſt, therefore thou ſhalt lift up thy head, therefore thou ſhalt aſcend up to Heaven, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. <hi>But we ſee Jeſus, who was made a little lower then the Angells, for the ſuffering of Death, crowned with glory and honour, that hee by the grace of God ſhould taſte death for every man.</hi> For ſuffering of Death, hee was crowned with Glory and Honour to tranſlate him bodily into heaven, that is a ſecond Argument.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Chriſt was taken up bodily to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:122181:111"/>heaven, it was to manifeſt to the World that Chriſt was God as well as man, to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt the God head of Jeſus Chriſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore taken up bodily to heaven, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.9, 10. <hi>Now that hee aſcended, what is it, but that hee alſo deſcended first into the lower parts of the Earth? Hee that deſcended, is the ſame alſo that aſcended up far above all Heavens, that he might fill all things.</hi> There the Apoſtle proves that Chriſts going up to heaven, it was an argument that Chriſt came downe from heaven, So in <hi>John</hi> 6.62. <hi>What and if yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man aſcend up where hee was before?</hi> That ſhews that Chriſt was in heaven before, therefore muſt bee God Coequall and Coeternall with God the Father, and thus you have the ſecond poynt diſpatched to you, ſhewing the reaſons why Jeſus Chriſt muſt go bodily into heaven.</p>
            <p>The third point is, I but what benefit and comfort is that to us that Jeſus Chriſt is now bodily in heaven, what comfort was this to the Diſciples that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould leave them, that hee muſt goe from them, unto his Fathers houſe? There are ſeven par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars that it is great ground of comfort to all the people of God that Jeſus Chriſt is gone bodily to heaven.</p>
            <p>The firſt ground of comfort is this, Chriſts going to heaven bodily, it aſſures you of Chriſts full Triumph and compleat conqueſt over all your ſpirituall Enemies; This the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:122181:112"/>Apoſtle lays down as a ground of comfort upon Chriſts Aſcention, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Wherefore he ſaith, when he aſcended up on high he led cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.</hi> That is, the Devill and Sinne that carried you captive, and Chriſt by his going up to heaven hath led them captive, that is, hath led your ſpirituall enemies that carried you captive: led them captive, Chriſt alluded to the cu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtome among the <hi>Romans,</hi> when the <hi>Roman</hi> Conquerour was to come to the Cardinall of <hi>Rome</hi> to rejoyce in his victory over his enemies, the Conquerour did uſe to tie his Captives to the Chariot-wheeles; So Chriſt did carry his Captives by his wheeles as it were, hee led captivity captive; <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.15. <hi>And having ſpoyled Principalities and Powers hee made a ſhew of them openly, Triumphing over them in it.</hi> So that Beloved here is one great comfort that Chriſt by going up to heaven doth manifeſt and declare to all the World that hee hath overcome the Grave, Death, Devill and Sinne; for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could they hold Chriſt in the chaines thereof.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Chriſts going bodily to heaven, It is a pledge to you that Chriſt will one day bring your bodies to heaven, I goe to heaven that I may receive you to my ſelfe, that you may be bodily in heaven where Chriſt is, In <hi>John</hi> 14.19. <hi>Yet a little while, and the World ſeeth mee no more, but yee ſee
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:122181:112"/>mee, becauſe I live, yee ſhall live alſo.</hi> As if hee ſhould ſay, well, I muſt leave you, and I muſt go to heaven before you, but becauſe I live in heaven, and live there bodily, you ſhall alſo live with mee in heaven with your bodies. <hi>Tertullian</hi> doth make this uſe of it to comfort the Chriſtians in his days, ſaith hee, Jeſus Chriſt did carry our fleſh into heaven with him, and hee is of our fleſh and of our bone; Now ſaith <hi>Tertullian, Jeſus Chriſt</hi> hath carried fleſh into heaven &amp; this is a good pledge unto us that our fleſh ſhall be in heaven where Chriſts is alſo. Therefore O fleſh and bloud doe thou rejoyce, thou haſt poſſeſt heaven in Chriſt already. And Chriſt would be imperfect in heaven, ſhould not the bodies of Believers come there alſo, becauſe he lives in heaven, you ſhall live there alſo.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Chriſts going bodily to heaven, it is a ground of comfort to you in this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt is gone bodily into heaven to performe and accompliſh his Sacerdotall Office, that is, as a high Prieſt, hee is now in heaven to performe the Office of a high Prieſt to make interceſſion to God his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in your behalfe, that your ſinnes might be pardoned, that your Soules might bee ſaved, that your bodies might be raiſed, and received into heaven with him in Glory, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24. <hi>For Chriſt is not entred into the holy places made with hands, which are the Figures of the true, but into heaven it ſelfe,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:122181:113"/>now to appeare in the preſence of God for us.</hi> Chriſt is entred into the very heavens that hee might appeare before God for us, ſo in <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.26. <hi>For ſuch an high Prieſt became us who is holy, harmeleſſe, undefiled ſeperate from ſinners, and made higher then the heavens.</hi> It became us to have a high Prieſt in Heaven. Therefore obſerve, though it was a great benefit to the Diſciples to have Chriſts Bodily preſence, yet Jeſus Chriſt could never have fulfilled the office of the Prieſt-hood to make interceſſion for all the Elect, if Chriſt had not gone bodily into heaven. Will you obſerve one <hi>Text</hi> in <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.4. <hi>For if hee were on Earth, hee ſhould not be a Prieſt, ſeeing that there are Prieſts that offer-gifts according to the Law.</hi> Chriſt muſt goe to heaven, and there hee is a Prieſt; Now if hee were upon the Earth hee could not be a Prieſt for us, therefore wee have great advantage by CHRISTS going into heaven. O beloved then looke on this as a great comfort, that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt is now in heaven in his Body, Fleſh and Bloud. appearing before God, making Interceſſion for all his people; This was typed out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.9, 10, 11 &amp; 12. <hi>verſes. And thou ſhalt take two Onix Stones, and grave on them the Names of the Children of Iſrael. Six of their Names on one ſtone, and the other ſix Names of the reſt on the other ſtone, according to their Birth. With the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:122181:113"/>worke of an ingraver in ſtone, like the ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings of a ſignet ſhalt thou ingrave the two ſtones, with the names of the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>thou ſhalt make them to be ſet in Ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of gold. And thou ſhalt put the two ſtones upon the ſhoulders of the</hi> Ephod, <hi>for ſtones of memoriall unto the Children of</hi> Iſrael. <hi>And</hi> Aaron <hi>ſhall beare their names before the Lord, upon his two ſhoulders for a memoriall.</hi> This is a Type of Jeſus Chriſt our high Prieſt, who is gone not into the holy of holieſt, but in it ſelfe the holy of holieſt, and there he hath not onely the names of all the Elect of God throughout the world on his Breaſt, but he hath them in his heart, and there he makes interceſſion for them to his Father. This is a Third ground of Comfort, that you have of Chriſts going bodily into Heaven, which aſſures you that Chriſt is now in Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> A Fourth ground of comfort you have by Chriſts going into Heaven is this, that Jeſus Chriſt is gone into heaven to convey to you a fuller communication of the gifts and graces of his ſpirit, then was beſtowed on his people whilſt hee was upon the Earth. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 8. <hi>Wherefore he ſaith, when he aſcended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.</hi> It is an illuſion to the Roman cuſtome, that when the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour rode in Triumph towards the Capitoll; he did not onely leade the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:122181:114"/>by the Charet wheeles, but likewiſe ſcattered mony to the Spectators that ſaw him ride along in triumph: ſo the Lord Jeſus Chriſt having by his Aſcenſion ſpoyled death and the Devill, this Jeſus Chriſt doth caſt his gifts unto men, diſpenſeth his graces in a greater meaſure into the hearts of his people, not that we are to run into the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian</hi> errour, becauſe of this text they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that before Chriſts Aſcenſion into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven there was no ſaving gifts of the ſpirit, and they ground it on that text, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. <hi>ver.</hi> 38, 39. <hi>He that believeth on me as the Scripture hath ſaid, out of his belly ſhall flow rivers of living water. But this spake he of the spirit, which they that believe on him, ſhould receive, for the holy Ghoſt was not yet given, becauſe that Jeſus was not yet glorified.</hi> The holy Ghoſt was not yet given, becauſe that Jeſus Chriſt was not yet glorified, but this <hi>Text</hi> is not to be taken ſimply, then it will follow that <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> had not the ſpirit, and they could not be in Heaven, but the meaning is, that the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt in that Aboundant meaſure was not given, becauſe Chriſt was yet aſcended, Chriſt did reſerve the full giving of the Holy Ghoſt to the time of his Aſcention, and untill hee was glorified; Therefore the Apoſtles ſoone after his Aſcention they received the Holy Ghoſt in a greater meaſure then was given to the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:122181:114"/>people of old, and beloved not onely gifts by Chriſt to bring you to Heaven, but alſo Miniſteriall gifts, to qualifie men fit for the Miniſtery, you are to looke on this as the fruit of Chriſts Aſcention, <hi>Epheſians</hi> 4.10, 11, 12. <hi>verſ. Hee that deſcended, is the ſame alſo that Aſcended up farre above all heavens that hee might fill all things. And hee gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Paſtors and Teachers. For the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtery, for the edifying of the body of Chriſt.</hi> So that you are to looke upon not onely your own Chriſtian gifts, whereby God brings you to Heaven, but all Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriall gifts are the fruits of Chriſts giving to Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, Chriſt is gone to Heaven, It is to comfort us in this, that Chriſt being bodily in Heaven it might make thee holdy bold and fiducially confident when ever thou comeſt to God in Prayer, thou doſt come to God in Prayer, but thou may be comeſt to him as thou haſt Jeſus Chriſt at his Right hand in Heaven preſenting thy Prayers to God for thee, there is this very comfort given in by the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.14, 16. <hi>Seeing then that wee have a great high Prieſt, that is paſſed into the Heavens, Ieſus the Sonne of God, let us hold faſt our profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Let us therefore come boldly unto the Throne of Grace, that we may obtaine mercy,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:122181:115"/>and finde grace to helpe in time of need.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt being in Heaven it ſhould worke a holy bodneſſe in us to keepe out feare and diſtruſt when thou prayeſt; becauſe we have an High Prieſt that is paſt into the higheſt Heavens Jeſus the Sonne of God. Who would not come boldly to the Court when hee knows that the Kings Eldeſt Sonne is his friend, and is aſſured of his love, that hee will intercede for him to his Father? Jeſus Chriſt is the King of Heaven the eldeſt Sonne, and hee is bound by Office to repreſent all our ſupplications and make Interceſſions for us.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixthly, that Chriſt being gone bodily into Heaven, it may bee of comfort, that though Jeſus Chriſt be gone bodily into Heaven, yet hee hath the ſame relation towards a Believer, which hee had to them whilſt hee was upon the Earth. When hee was on the Earth, did Chriſt ſay, go tell my Brethren that I am to aſcend, and after hee was taken up into Heaven, yet hee calls them his Brethren. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.11. <hi>For both hee that ſanctifieth, and they who are ſanctified, are all of one, for which cauſe hee is not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to call them Brethren.</hi> Though Chriſt was crowned with glory and gone up to Heaven, yet hee was not aſhamed to call Believers Brethren; Now in Heaven Chriſt is thy God there, and Chriſt is thy Father there, Chriſt is thy Prince there, and Chriſt
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:122181:115"/>is thy friend there, and this may adminiſter much comfort to thee that Jeſus Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines the ſame relation now he is in heaven, that he had with thee in the world; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Iob</hi> could ſpeak in a viſion, ſaith <hi>Job, I know that my Redeemer liveth,</hi> I know my Kinſman liveth, (for ſo theword ſignifieth) I know my kinſman liveth. <hi>Chriſt</hi> did only call his Diſciples Brothers when hee was in the fleſh, and ſo hee calleth them Brothers now is in heaven. Suppoſe thou art a poor woman that doſt marry a man that is mean &amp; poor in the world, why ſuppoſe this man ſhould come to the dignity of a King, it would be a great comfort to thee that thou that waſt but a beggar art now become a Kings Wife; ſo, though thou art mean in the world, yet <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> doth preferre thee to be his Brother.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Seventhly and laſtly, it may ſerve for comfort in this regard, that Chriſt is gone to Heaven for this very purpoſe, to prepare Heaven for thee; I go to prepare a place for you, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6 20. <hi>Whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jeſus, made an high Prieſt for ever after the order of Melchiſedec.</hi> Chriſt is our forerunner, gone to Heaven before us, and gone to Heaven for us, Chriſt did not onely dye for us, but Chriſt did go to heaven for us, all was for us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19.20. <hi>Having therefore Brethren, boldneſſe to enter into the holieſt by the blood of Ieſus. By a new and living way which hee hath conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:122181:116"/>for us, through the vaile, that is to ſay, his fleſh;</hi> That is, having hopes to come to enter into Heaven by the blood of Chriſt, through Chriſts fleſh as dying on the Croſſe. And thus much be ſpoken for the Doctrinall part of this poynt, the poynt was this; That Chriſts Aſcention or going up bodily to Heaven is a ground of great comfort to Gods people whilſt they live here upon the Earth.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now draw out ſome inſtructions from ſome circumſtances in Chriſts going to Heaven. There are five circumſtances from which you may gather ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, from the time when Chriſt did leave this World and aſcend up to goe to Heaven, if you reade the Evangeliſts they will tell you it was about the 33 yeare of his Age, hee left this World and goeth up to Heaven. Learne thus much from thence, that if Chriſt would leave the World in the flower of his Age, a young man, then this ſhould be faſtened on the Meditation of you young men that you ſhould not have your hearts too much glued to the World, to hancker after a long life. Suppoſe God ſhould take thee away now in the flower of thy age, now God took Chriſt away ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, you may learne ſomewhat from the place whence Chriſt did aſcend, it is very obſervable; It was Mount Olivet,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:122181:116"/>
               <hi>Acts</hi> 1.12. <hi>Then returned they unto Ieruſalem from the Mount called Olivet which is from Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem a Sabbath days Journey.</hi> Luke <hi>ſaith, it was from Bethany.</hi> Luke 24.50.51. <hi>And hee led them out as farre as to Bethany, and hee lifted up his hands and bleſſed them. And it came to paſſe while hee bleſſed them, hee was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.</hi> It was all one, but there is much of Gods minde in this, of all places in the World Chriſt did make choyce of <hi>Bethany</hi> by Mount <hi>Olivet</hi> to go up to Heaven: Beloved the reaſon was, becauſe that was the place that Chriſt was taken in when <hi>Judas</hi> came with the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> to apprehend him, from that place hee was taken to be crucified, and ſeeing it was from that place, hee would make choyce of that place, that from thence hee would take his riſe to go up to Heaven, <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>Bethany</hi> in Hebrew, ſignifies a houſe of affliction, ſo that Chriſt made that which was the houſe of his affliction, Chriſt made that <hi>Bethany</hi> to be the place of the tranſlation of him into glory, I would give you thence to note that God doth oftentimes make our ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings to be Inlets to our glory. So it was with Chriſt, from <hi>Bethany</hi> hee was taken a Priſoner, and from that place hee would aſcend up into Heaven, ſo if you ſuffer with him, you ſhall alſo be glorified with him, you may be carried to Heaven ſometime in
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:122181:117"/>ways of ſharpe afflictions, therefore doe not be danted at perſecution, for the Lord makes <hi>Bethanies,</hi> the houſes of our afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to have a trap-doore in them to let us into our Fathers Manſion.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, from the circumſtance in Chriſt aſcention, juſt as Chriſt did aſcend he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> was ſpeaking to his Diſciples things that did appertaine to the Kingdome of God, and as hee was bleſſing of them, hee was taken up before their eyes, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.9. <hi>And when hee had ſpoken theſe things, while they beheld, hee was taken up, and a Cloud received him out of their ſight;</hi> Whileſt hee was bleſſing of his Diſciples, and whileſt hee was ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, things appertaining to the Kingdome of God, hee was taken away. I would give you this note from thence, that when you come towards the time of your departure out of this World, make Chriſt your example, Chriſt as hee was going away hee ſpake of things appertaining to the Kingdome of God, ſo let your hearts be full fraught with Divine contemplation, do you leave good counſell behinde you when you come to die, that ſo ſome body may ſay, theſe are the laſt words of a dying Friend. I might extend this Example of Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his departure out of the World, unto maſters of Families, that when you come towards your end, leave good councell behind you; Let not your ſpeech be filled
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:122181:117"/>about worldly affaires, but let that be ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led before, but leave good councell with your children. <hi>Jacob</hi> when hee was to die, hee called all his children about him and gave good councell unto them and bleſſed them. Likewiſe of <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.9. <hi>And thou</hi> Solomon <hi>my Sonne, know thou the God of thy Father, and ſerve him with a perfect heart, and with a willing minde, for the Lord ſearcheth all Hearts, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts, if thou ſeeke him, hee will be found of thee, but if thou forſake him, hee will caſt thee off for ever.</hi> And thus wee ſee in the inſtances of <hi>Iſaac</hi> and many other Servants of God, <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>Joſhua</hi> when hee was to die, I but take Chriſts Example ſo farre, that when you are to leave the World, that you may have your minds poſſeſſed with nothing elſe but with things appertaining to the Kingdom of God, as Chriſt was.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, there is inſtruction to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from the manner of Chriſts leaving the World, the manner was in the <hi>Acts</hi> 1.9. <hi>And when hee had spoken theſe things, while they beheld, hee was taken up, and a cloud received him out of their ſight.</hi> They ſaw him by degrees aſcend into Heaven, this muſt not paſſe our Meditation, that a cloud ſhould take Jeſus Chriſt out of our ſight, it is for a reliefe to your Meditations, that when you ſee the clouds, that theſe cloud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:122181:118"/>that I ſee hover in the Heaven they are Chriſts Chariot that did once carry him to Heaven, and they are the chariots that ſhall carry Jeſus Chriſt to judge the World; O labour to have your Meditations on Divine things, hee went up in a cloud, therefore the clouds are called Gods Chariots.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, the circumſtance in Chriſts aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention is this, that hee would call all his Friends about him, it is expreſly ſaid all the eleven Apoſtles were with him, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. And an Interpreter doth think that there was an hundred and twenty with Jeſus Chriſt, when he aſcended up into Heaven, &amp; he gathered it from, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.15. <hi>And in thoſe days</hi> Peter <hi>ſtood up in the midſt of the Diſciples, and ſaid, The number of Names together, were about an hundred and twenty.</hi> Now learned men doe thinke that there was an hundered and twenty that did ſee Jeſus Chriſt aſcend up into Heaven, it is cleare that there were the eleven Apoſtles there, and if this be ſo that Chriſt gathered about him, his Friends, when hee was to leave the World, I gather thence, that when you are drawing towards your end and depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the World; Labour to have your Friends about you that you might give them the advice of a dying Friend, and it is a great bleſſing for to die amongſt your Friends, Chriſt before that hee would goe up to Heaven and leave the World, hee
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:122181:118"/>would have his Friends about him, and then hee was taken up from them.</p>
            <p>I now come to draw out more practicall application of this poynt. If it be ſo that Chriſts going up bodily into Heaven be a ground of ſuch great comfort unto the people of God upon Earth, the uſe that I ſhall draw, it ſhall be to deduce foure Doctrinall and foure practicall inferences from this poynt.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, this poynt it confute the opinion of the <hi>Selucians</hi> and <hi>Herliani</hi> that hold that Chriſts Body is not in Heaven, but that it is in the beautifull and ſplendent body of the Sun, and they ſay, that is the reaſon the Sun doth caſt ſuch a glorious light, o're that the Moon doth, and truly this old Hereſie is againe revived amongſt us, and I have ſeene it in a booke called <hi>Divine Light,</hi> when indeed it is nothing but darkeneſſe, but Chriſt is above the Sun, Chriſt is above all the viſible Heavens: Chriſt ſits in the third Heaven as <hi>Paul</hi> calls it; therefore if Chriſts Body be gone into Heaven, they are in an errour.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, this poynt will confute thoſe who hold that Chriſts Body hath beene on Earth, ſince his aſcention into Heaven; Some in <hi>Germany</hi> held that they were the very Chriſt, and thus in King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eights days, there was one held that hee was the Chriſt, and his ſide was pearc't, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:122181:119"/>there was Nayles ſeene in his hand, &amp;c. I but if men ſay, loe here is Chriſt, and there is Chriſt believe them not, for Chriſt was never on the Earth ſince his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, that Chriſts Body is now in Heaven, it overthrowes the Doctrine of the Popiſh Religion touching Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or the reall preſence, that Jeſus Chriſt is bodily preſent at the Sacrament, ſay the Papiſts, we really eate Chriſts fleſh and drink Chriſts bloud, that Chriſt is as really at the Sacrament as hee was on the Croſſe; If there were no other argument to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw this Opinion but this, that the body of Chriſt is now in Heaven it were enough, then that Opinion of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> is hereby confuted, Chriſts Body cannot be in Heaven, and on the Earth both at one time.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, the aſcenſion of Chriſt, it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws the Opinion of the <hi>Carpocraciani</hi> that hold, that onely his ſoule did goe to Heaven, and his body periſhed as others; And this cannot be, for the Diſciples ſaid, that they ſaw Chriſt aſcend, and this muſt be his Body, for they could not ſee his ſoul, for the ſoule is a ſpirit. Now you ſee the reaſon why I ſpent ſo much time in the morning in giving you many <hi>Texts</hi> of Scripture to prove this poynt: becauſe there are ſo many Hereticks that doe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:122181:119"/>oppugne this Doctrine of CHRISTS Aſcenſion. I now come to give you three or foure practicall deductions.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, is Chriſts body now in Heaven? then I infer; O thou that canſt lay a groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded clayme for an intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt; O be not thou afrayd to die, doe not thou be afrayd to die that canſt lay a claime in Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe thy Chriſt is in Heaven, and when thou dieſt, death is but a Trap-doore to let thee in to endleſſe joy where Chriſt is, why ſhould wee bee as children to looke on death as a Bugbeare, but looke upon death as being a paſſage into thy Fathers houſe, as being a Trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doore to let thee in where Jeſus Chriſt is, <hi>Gen.</hi> 45.25.27. <hi>And they went up out of Aegypt, and came into the Land of Canaan, unto</hi> Jacob <hi>their Father. And they told him all the words of</hi> Joſeph <hi>which hee had ſaid unto them, and when hee ſaw the Waggons which</hi> Joſeph <hi>had ſent to carry him, the spirit of</hi> Iacob <hi>their Father revived.</hi> Did <hi>Jacob</hi> rejoyce to ſee a Wagon or a Chariot that would carry him into <hi>Aegypt</hi> to ſee his Sonne <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and wilt not thou rejoyce to thinke that death is a chariot to carry thee to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to carry thee to Heaven? O therefore let not thy heart be troubled to die, becauſe death is but a chariot to carry thee to Heaven; Is Chriſt gone into heaven?</p>
            <pb n="30" facs="tcp:122181:120"/>
            <p>Then ſecondly, labour thou whilſt thou liveſt on the Earth to aſcend to Chriſt in Divine and holy Ejaculations and Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; Is Chriſt in Heaven? then why ſhould not thy heart be where thy head is, why ſhouldſt thou be grovelling on the Earth ſeeing thy Chriſt is now in Heaven? It is a ſpeech of Chriſt, <hi>Canticles</hi> 3.6. <hi>Who is this that cometh out of the Wilderneſſe like Pillars of ſmoke, perfumed with Myrrhe and Franck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incenſe, with all powders of the Merchant?</hi> Thou ſhouldſt aſcend up to Chriſt though thou beeſt in trouble in the Wilderneſſe of this World; O aſcend up to Chriſt in holy Meditations, the uſe the Apoſtle makes of it, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.1. <hi>If yee then be riſen with Chriſt, ſeeke thoſe things which are above, where Chriſt ſitteth on the right Hand of God.</hi> The argument is, where Chriſt ſits at the right Hand of God, ſet your affections there: and ſo in the <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20. <hi>For our converſation is in Heaven, from whence alſo wee looke for the Saviour, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Chriſt is in Heaven, therefore our converſation muſt be where our head is. It is a notable <hi>Text, Mat.</hi> 24.28. <hi>For whereſoever the Carkeiſe is, there will the Eagles be gathered together.</hi> That Chriſt being in Heaven it ſhould make you aſcend in your hearts heavenward; It is true, there are ſome that wreſt theſe words, and give this ſence of them, that they make the carkeiſe to be the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:122181:120"/>Jewes, and the Eagles to be the Romans, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Romans diduſe the Eagle in their Banner and Enſigne of War, therefore they ſay where the Jews were the Romans ſhould come, though this was a truth, yet not the ſcope of the <hi>Text,</hi> it is generally overthrowne by moſt Interpreters; But where the carkeiſe is, thither will the Eagles reſort, <hi>Gerrard</hi> doth chiefly referre it to the day of judgement, where the carkeiſe is thither will the Eagles reſort, that is, where <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is in Heaven, as the Eagles doe follow after the carkeiſe to feed upon that, ſo the people of God as Eagles are gathered about a carkeiſe, the people of God ſhall be gathered about <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and this I doe confeſſe is the chiefe ſcope of the place, and doe believe it is the chief intendment of the holy Ghoſt, but <hi>Gerrard</hi> hee makes another uſe of it too, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres it to the power and efficacy of the Goſpell in this Life; Chriſt is now in Heaven, ſaith <hi>Gerrard,</hi> that the Goſpell ſhall be as powerfull on men in the World, that it ſhall make men as eager to come after Chriſt into Heaven as the Eagle is after the prey, ſo your Soules ſhall be as eager after the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in heaven as the Eagle is after her prey.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, I infer hence, that before you preſume to apply the benefits and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of Chriſts Aſcention into Heaven:
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:122181:121"/>labour to feele in your own hearts the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of Chriſts Death and Aſcention, every man applies the Benefit of Chriſts Death, and Reſurrection, and Chriſts Aſcention before they finde the efficacy of his Death, and the efficacy of his Reſurrection; It is the Apoſtles word, ſaith hee, I labour to finde the power of his Reſurrection, ſo do you labour to finde the power of his Death and the power of his Aſcention, before you finde the comfort of it; It is to make thee leſs Earthly minded, more paſſionately eager, and importunely earneſt after the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> doſt thou feele the power of his Aſcention to make thee more heavenly minded, and leſſe earthly minded? O labour to feele the efficacy and power of it, elſe I might ſay to you as <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid to his Mother in <hi>Geneſis</hi> 27.12. <hi>My Father per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure will feele mee, and I ſhall ſeeme to him as a deceiver, and I ſhall bring a curſe upon mee and not a bleſſing.</hi> Nay without a peradventure God will feele and try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you are men or no that have right to a bleſſing: that ſhall have any reall advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by the benefit of Chriſts Death, of Chriſts Reſurrection and Aſcention. God will try whether you doe not ſeeke to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive your owne Soules and deceive God himſelfe; if ſo, you will rather have a curſe then a bleſſing, if you ſeeke to apply the comfort of Chriſts Aſcention, before you
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:122181:121"/>feele the efficacy of it on your owne hearts.</p>
            <p>For thoſe that hold Chriſts Aſcention with us, yet they doe vary about ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, about the manner of Chriſts going away; which I give it to you in theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, Chriſt went to Heaven viſibly, in <hi>Acts</hi> 1. It was no tranſcient glance of the Eye, but they ſtedfaſtly beheld <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> they ſaw him when hee went away. Againe,</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Chriſt went to Heaven bodily: therefore thoſe do erre that hold that onely his Soule did goe to Heaven, and his body periſhed as others doe.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, hee went to Heaven locally, hee aſcended locally, there are ſome men that hold, that every place is Heaven where God is, that is a truth; but Heaven is a diſtinct place from the Earth and Hell, Chriſt had a mutation of place from the Earth to the third heaven, therefore ſaith he, the Earth ſhall hold me no more.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, hee did aſcend into Heaven powerfully; Indeed other men went to Heaven bodily, not by their own ſtrength, but it was by a borrowed ſtrength, <hi>Elias</hi> had a fiery charriot to carry him to heaven, but Chriſt had none, for he went to heaven by his own ſtrength.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Chriſt went to Heaven, though not
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:122181:122"/>ſingly yet hee went to heaven bodily. There are three bodies in Heaven, there is the body of <hi>Enoch,</hi> the body of <hi>Elias,</hi> and the body of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> all in heaven elſe are onely Spirits, Saints and Angels, <hi>Enoch</hi> went to heaven bodily as a Type of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion before the Law, and <hi>Elias</hi> under the Law, &amp; <hi>Chriſt</hi> under the Goſpel. Divines ſay, that this ſhewes there was Salvation by Chriſt before the Law, and there was Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Chriſt under the Law, and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Chriſt in the time of the Goſpell, but there is a difference betweene their going to heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> went to heaven, but they did not die and riſe from the dead, and then aſcend into heaven, but firſt Chriſt dyed, and then Chriſt was raiſed out of the Grave, and then within forty dayes hee did aſcend into heaven, there was one difference. Againe, they did not aſcend to heaven by their owne ſtrength, but by the power of God, they did aſcend into heaven, but wee have got no good by their Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, no benefit or merit accrues unto us by their being in heaven, but there is great benefit redounding to us by Chriſts being in heaven, for ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I goe to Heaven to prepare a place for you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, <hi>Enoch</hi> went to heaven, but hee could not give the Spirit, ſo <hi>Elias</hi> went to heaven but hee could not give the Spirit;
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:122181:122"/>I but our <hi>Lord Jeſus Christ</hi> he is gone bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into heaven, hee hath Aſcended up on high, and hath given gifts unto men.</p>
            <p>Againe, they went to heaven, ſaith <hi>Polanus,</hi> onely as Citizens of heaven; but Chriſt went to heaven as the Lord of heaven, who is there in his body and in his perſon, and theſe are the ſhort and tranſcient hints that I have given you on the firſt part of the <hi>Text.</hi>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, by way of Repreſentation, Chriſt is not gone to heaven as every man, as a ſingle and private perſon, but Chriſt is gone into heaven as a common and a publique perſon; Chriſt is gone up to heaven with fleſh and blood, and with our natures hee is gone to heaven, and hee is gone there as a Repreſenter of all the Elect; <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is gone to heaven repreſenting the perſons of all the Elect of God upon the Earth. Hence it is that you have a paſſage, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.6. <hi>And hath raiſed us up together, and made us ſit together in heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> We are not in heavenly places, wee are in earthly places, but wee doe ſit in heaven: becauſe Chriſt is now in heaven, hee being gone to heaven as a common and a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique perſon, a Repreſenter of all the elect, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.20. <hi>Whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jeſus, made an high Prieſt for ever after the Order of Melchiſedec.</hi> Hee did not goe there for himſelfe, but for us.

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Chriſt prepares a place for the Elect by way of interceſſion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24. <hi>For Chriſt is not entred into the holy places made with hands, which are the Figures of the true, but into Heaven it ſelfe, now to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in the preſence of God for us.</hi> That as the Prieſt under the Law when hee went to the holy places, hee had the Names of all the Tribes on his breaſt, ſo the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> our great high Prieſt having the Names of all the Elect not only on his breaſt but in his heart, praying to his Father that wee might come there, and by vertue of his Interceſſion, that in another way that heaven is prepared.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, Chriſt is ſaid to prepare heaven for us by way of Operation in us, hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares heaven for us by preparing us for
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:122181:124"/>heaven, and this is the ſence that <hi>Auſtin</hi> gives of theſe words, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> prepares a Manſion for us in heaven, when hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares us the Inhabitants for Heaven, here is the great evidence for Heaven, are your hearts prepared? then you may be aſſured that Heaven is prepared for you, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.12, 13, 14 <hi>Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in Light. Who hath delivered us from the power of darkeneſſe, and hath tranſlated us into the Kingdome of his deare Sonne. In whom wee have Redemption, through his blood, even the forgiveneſſe of ſinnes.</hi> An unconverted man is not a meet man for Heaven, now when Chriſt makes you meete for Heaven, hee then prepares a place for thee, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 1.3, 4, 5. <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which according to his abundant mercy, hath begotten us againe unto a lively hope, by the Reſurrection of Ieſus from the Dead. To an Inheritance, Incorruptible and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reſerved in heaven for you; Who are kept by the power of God through Faith and Salvation, ready to be revealed in the laſt time.</hi> So that beloved if you be kept for Heaven, and made meete for Heaven, that is a demonſtration that Heaven is prepared for you.</p>
            <p>I now come to the ſecond Quere, which is this, I but how can this Scripture ſay
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:122181:124"/>that by Chriſts Aſcention Heaven is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for us, when other Scriptures ſay <hi>that heaven was prepared for us from the beginning of the World? Mat.</hi> 25.34 <hi>Then ſhall the King ſay unto them on his right hand, Come yee bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdome prepared for you from the founda<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of the World:</hi> Now if a Kingdome was prepared for them from the beginning of the World, how doth this Scripture ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate a preparing of the Kingdome of Heaven, but from the Aſcenſion of Chriſt? Divines doe anſwer, That you muſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between the decrees of God, and betweene the cleare manifeſtation and full execution of thoſe decrees. Now if you reſpect the decrees of God, then the Scripture is true, that the Kingdome of heaven is prepared from the beginning of the World, for the decree and purpoſe of God was, before the World was, that the Elect ſhould have Heaven as an Inheritance, but if you expect the cleare manifeſtation of it, then it was not till Jeſus Chriſt Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended, and this diſtinction the Scripture allows of it, eſpecially of the poynt of Juſtification, in this poynt the Scripture doth cleare this diſtinction, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.8. <hi>The Holy Ghoſt this ſignifying, that the way into the holieſt of all, was not yet made manifeſt, while as the firſt Tabernacle was yet ſtanding.</hi> The meaning is this, that the way to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:122181:125"/>Heaven it was not manifeſt to the Jewes whilſt their Tabernacle ſtood, that is, whilſt their Leviticall Ceremonies were in uſe, the way to Heaven was not manifeſt, the godly went to Heaven before Chriſts time, but it was not manifeſted, for the common ſort of the Jewes did not underſtand that by <hi>Jeſus Chriſts</hi> Paſſion and Aſcenſion they muſt come to Heaven; therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, the way to the holieſt of all was not yet manifeſted whilſt their firſt Tabernacle ſtood; So my Text is true that Heaven was prepared for Believers by the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> by his Aſcenſion.</p>
            <p>The third Quere is this, I but you will ſay, if Chriſt by his Aſcenſion into Heaven did prepare Heaven for Believers; then what became of all the people of God, and holy men of God under the old Teſtament? Whither went they that if this bee true that Chriſt did prepare Heaven by his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion?</p>
            <p>The Jeſuites raiſe this difficulty from this Text. They ſay that before Chriſt Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended none did goe to Heaven, therefore they make <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> all the Patriarks and all the holy men of God, they make them to be in the place called <hi>Limbus Patrum,</hi> which was for the good men till Chriſts Aſcenſion; Then there is <hi>Limbus Infantum,</hi> a place of receipt of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants. Then there is <hi>Purgatory</hi> for men
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:122181:125"/>guilty of groſſe ſins, Heaven and Hell they concurre in to be a truth; <hi>Limbus Patrum,</hi> ſay they, was the place to receive all the good men till Chriſts Aſcenſion, and then Chriſt tooke them all into Heaven, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Divines doe take a great deale of paines to vindicate this Text.</p>
            <p>If you will aske mee what is become of the Patriarks and all the good men of old before Chriſts going into Heaven, how can they come to Heaven if Heaven be prepared by Chriſts Aſcenſion?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, I may ſay that of Chriſts Aſcenſion, as <hi>Gerrard</hi> doth of Chriſts Paſſion; The Death of Chriſt it was availeable before it was in being, ſo I may ſay of Chriſts Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion, that Chriſts Aſcenſion was availe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able before it was in being; <hi>Gerrard</hi> hee hath another paſſage, that the benefits wee have by Chriſt, they are not onely to be reſtrained to ages that are to come after Chriſt, but to looke backward to all ages before Chriſt, <hi>Revel.</hi> 5.9. <hi>And they ſung a new Song, ſaying; Thou art worthy to take the Booke, and to open the Seales thereof, for thou waſt ſlaine, and haſt redeemed us to God by thy Blood, out of every Kindred, and Tongue, and People, and Nation.</hi> Not only the Lambe ſlaine decretively in Gods Decree, not onely the Lambe ſlaine Typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally in the ceremoniall Sacrifices, but virtually, that there was vertue in <hi>Jeſus</hi>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:122181:126"/>Chriſt, that all the godly Jewes had vertue by CHRISTS Death, there is my firſt Anſwer.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, obſerve this; That the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth not ſay that Chriſt by going up to heaven did open heaven for us, but onely to prepare heaven for us, hee being our Mediator ſitting at Gods right Hand in Heaven, Heaven was open before, but not ſo fully adorned as it was by Chriſts Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.8. <hi>The holy Ghoſt this ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, that the way into the holiest of all, was not yet made manifeſt, while as the firſt Tabernacle was yet ſtanding.</hi> The <hi>Grecians</hi> doe obſerve that Chriſt doth not uſe a word that ſignifies to open a thing that is ſhut, but to open, cleare, and manifeſt a thing that is obſcure, it was open before.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, there are againſt the Jeſuits conceit of <hi>Limbus Patrum,</hi> that there are cleare paſſages in the Scripture and undeny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able reaſons drawn from the Scripture that doth prove Believers under the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment went to Heaven before CHRISTS Aſcenſion; As in <hi>Luke</hi> 16.22. <hi>And it came to paſſe that the Beggar dyed, and was carried by the Angells into</hi> Abrahams <hi>Boſome: the Rich man alſo dyed, and was buried.</hi> Hee lived two thouſand years and more before Chriſt was borne, heaven is called <hi>Abrahams</hi> Boſome, and the Elect that dyed are ſaid to goe into <hi>Abrahams</hi> Boſome, and <hi>Eliah</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:122181:126"/>and <hi>Enoch</hi> are in Heaven perfectly, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.5. By Faith <hi>Enoch</hi> was tranſlated, that hee ſhould not ſee death, and was not found, becauſe God had tranſlated him. And in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. there the bodies of the Patriarks are reckoned up together, in the 16 <hi>verſe. But now they deſire a better Countrey, that is Heavenly, wherefore God is not aſhamed to be called their God, for hee hath prepared for them a City.</hi> He is not aſhamed to be their God, therefore they have a City prepared for them by God, that likewiſe if it be a Hiſtory or a Parable, <hi>Lazarus</hi> was ſaid to be carried by Angels into <hi>Abrahams</hi> Boſome, this was before Chriſt dyed: then frequent Scriptures there are, touching Chriſts transfiguration that when Chriſt was taken up, that hee ſaw <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> from thence Divines gather that they muſt be in Heaven. There are foure undeniable Reaſons that will prove that the godly before Chriſts Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion they went to Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, it appeares by this, becauſe it is ſaid, that thoſe that were carried to heaven, they were carried to heaven by the Angels, the Angels carried <hi>Lazarus</hi> into <hi>Abrahams</hi> Boſome; now certainly Angels are not in <hi>Limbus Patrum, Luke</hi> 16.22. Againe if the Believers of old ſhould not go into heaven, then the Death and Merits of Chriſt would be much extenuated, Heb. 13.8. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the ſame yeſterday, and to day, and for ever.</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:122181:127"/>He was the ſame yeſterday, that is, before he was borne hee was of uſe then as well as after time.</p>
            <p>Againe, if the Soules of wicked men be in Hell before Chriſts time, then the Soules of godly men muſt bee in heaven before Chriſts time, that muſt clearly follow by the Rules of contrary; now that wicked men went to Hell is cleare <hi>Jude</hi> 7. <hi>Even as</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah, <hi>and the Cities about them, in like manner giving themſelves over to Fornication, and going after ſtrange fleſh, are ſet forth for an example ſuffering the vengeance of eternall Fire.</hi> They went to hell before Chriſts time, therefore cleare it muſt follow that the Elect muſt goe to Heaven before Chriſts time.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, there is the very ſame reaſon why Believers ſhould goe to heaven before Chriſts Aſcenſion, as there is why they ſhould go to heaven after Chriſts Aſcenſion, becauſe Believers under the old Teſtament, they had the ſame Goſpell preached to them as now wee have, and they had the ſame Spirit, the ſame Faith, the ſame Chriſt, and under the ſame Covenant, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore why muſt they not goe to the ſame place? I ſhall clearly prove this unto you. Firſt, they had the ſame Spirit and the ſame Faith that wee had, and this is laid downe by the Apoſtle, in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Wee having the ſame Spirit of Faith, according as it is
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:122181:127"/>written, I believed and therefore have I spoken, wee alſo believe and therefore ſpeak;</hi> and they with us had the ſame juſtifying Faith. Then for circumciſion, it was a ſigne of righteouſneſſe by Faith. And then againe, they had the ſame Goſpell that wee have, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.2. <hi>For unto us was the ſame Gospell Preached, as well as unto them: but the word Preached did not profit them, not being mixt with Faith in them that heard it.</hi> The ſame Goſpell, onely theirs was darke, for the ceremoniall Law was Goſpell; meerely Types and Shadowes to come, Shadowes of Salvation by Chriſts Bloud, to them was the Goſpell Preached as well as unto us; Nay they had the ſame Chriſt as wee have, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. <hi>And did all drinke the ſame spirituall drinke, for they dranke of that Sipirituall Rock that followed them, and that Rock was Chriſt.</hi> And in the Wilderneſſe it is ſaid, Let us not tempt Chriſt as they alſo tempted him, they ſinned againſt Chriſt in the Wilderneſſe, and they enjoyed Chriſt in the Wilderneſſe: ſo that they had the ſame Chriſt as wee have; Againe they are under the ſame Covenant that wee are, <hi>Jeremiah</hi> 31. It is the ſame Covenant with ours in <hi>Hebrewes</hi> 8. So that is there not the ſame reaſon why Believers under the old Teſtament ſhould goe to the ſame place as Believers under the new, for they had the ſame ſpirit, the ſame Faith, the ſame Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:122181:128"/>the ſame Chriſt, and under the ſame Covenant, therefore they muſt needs go to the ſame place, though heaven be prepared by Chriſts Aſcenſion, yet heaven was opened before, yet not ſo manifeſted before as ſince Chriſt Dyed, Roſe and went up to Heaven.</p>

We reade in <hi>Revel.</hi> 19.7. <hi>Let us be glad and rejoyce, and give honour to him, for the Marriage of the Lamb is come, and his Wife hath made her ſelfe ready.</hi> O be thou as the Bride, make thy ſelfe ready for the Marriage day, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trothing day was when Chriſt went up to heaven, thy Marriage day is thy dying day; O againſt the Marriage day of the Lambe, doe thou who art his Bride make thy ſelfe ready, doe thou prepare a heart for Chriſt who hath prepared heaven for thee. <hi>Origen</hi>

It may be many of you have poor cottages, ſmoaky houſes, why for all that, lift up thy heart with joy, that Chriſt is gone to prepare a large place in Heaven for thee. <hi>Ballans</hi> the <hi>Arrian</hi> Emperour, when hee did threaten <hi>Baſill,</hi> and ſaid that neither by Sea not Land hee ſhould be ſafe from his power, yet ſaith <hi>Baſil.</hi> for all the Emperours rage, I ſhall be either in Heaven or under Heaven.

For the Lord himſelfe ſhall deſcend from Heaven with a ſheut, with the voyce of the Archangell, and with the Trumpe of God, and the dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt.

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:122181:131"/>and ſo ſhall wee ever bee with the Lord; Wherefore comfort one another, with theſe words.</hi> In the handling of this there are three particulars, and then the uſe.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The firſt is by way of Objection, what comfort is this to us, or to them that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould bid them they ſhould not be troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, that hee would come againe, when betweene the making of this accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and this time it hath run above 1600 years already?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Firſt, that Tract of time can neither interrupt the accompliſhment of a promiſe, nor the comfort of a promiſe, it is comfortable that what is promiſed ſhall ſooner or later come to paſſe, eſpecially in this, wherein all the comforts of the Elect of God are reſerved to the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Daniel</hi> 10.1. <hi>In the third yeare of</hi> Cyrus, <hi>King of</hi> Perſia, <hi>a thing was revealed unto</hi> Daniel, <hi>whoſe Name was called</hi> Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſhazzar, <hi>and the thing was true, but the time appointed was long, and hee underſtood the thing, and had underſtanding of the viſion.</hi> It is a promiſe made by <hi>Chriſt</hi> to comfort you againſt all the troubles of the World, hee will come againe, and though the time be long ere hee doth come, yet the time appointed will be true, it is certaine, though it be long.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, that the godly in ages before
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:122181:132"/>us, they could rejoyce in promiſes being made to them, though the accompliſhment thereof was not fulfilled till many yeares after, and why ſhould not the Diſciples be ſo, then, and why ſhould not wee be ſo now? I will give you two or three inſtances, <hi>John</hi> 8.56. <hi>Your Father</hi> Abraham <hi>rejoyced to ſee my day, and hee ſaw it, and was glad. Abraham</hi> that had a promiſe of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the promiſe was made to <hi>Abraham</hi> above a thouſand years before hee ſaw him, and he was glad, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13. <hi>Theſe all dyed in Faith, not having received the promiſes, but having ſeene them afarre off, and were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of them, and embraced them.</hi> They did embrace the promiſe, though they were farre off in their accompliſhment. An excellent Text you have in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 9.6. <hi>For unto us a Child is borne, unto us a Sonne is given, and the government ſhall be upon his ſhoulders, &amp;c.</hi> Behold this is matter of joy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>The next particular is, I but how doth it appeare that <hi>Chriſts</hi> coming to judge the World is a Doctrine ſo full of comfort to Believers?</p>

            <p>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, in caſe of any ſcandalous aſperſions, or any unjuſt imputation which is laid upon thee, it may ſerve for great comfort to thee in this caſe. The Apoſtle gives it you, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3, 4. <hi>But with mee it is a very ſmall thing that I ſhould be judged of you, or of mans judgement, yea, I judge not mine own ſelfe. For I know nothing by my ſelfe, yet am I not hereby juſtified, but hee that judgeth mee, is the Lord.</hi> Cenſure mee what you will, and judge of mee what you pleaſe, for hee that judgeth mee ſhall be the Lord, therefore it is a ſmall matter that I am judged of. Why ſuppoſe thou art judged, thou art ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized, and thou art aſperſed in the World, why appeale to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in Heaven, for hee that judgeth thee, is the Lord, and this wee finde Chriſt did, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.23. <hi>Who when hee was reviled, reviled not againe, when hee ſuffered, hee threatned not, but comitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to him that judgeth righteouſly.</hi> When thou art reviled, and aſperſed, and cenſured, why do not revile againe, do not cenſure againe, but do as Chriſt did, commit thy cauſe to Chriſt that judgeth all things righteouſly. Chriſt will come to over-judge all things that have beene judged amiſſe. <hi>Jude,</hi> 1.5.

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Chriſts coming againe it is a Doctrine of comfort in this cauſe, in caſe of all Preſecution thou undergoeſt from men, for Chriſt, for the Goſpell, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.6.7. <hi>Seeing it is a righteous thing with God, to recompence tribulation to them that trouble you. And to you who are troubled, reſt with us, when the Lord Ieſus ſhall be revealed from Heaven, with his mighty Angels.</hi> As if hee ſhould have ſaid, you are troubled and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted about the Goſpell for Chriſts ſake, why be not troubled, for Chriſt is coming from Heaven, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 4.13. <hi>But rejoyce, in aſmuch as yee are partakers of Chriſts ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that when his glory ſhall be revealed, ye may be glad alſo with exceeding joy.</hi> When Chriſt comes to be revealed and judge the World, why rejoyce in your ſufferings, you ſhall be glad alſo with exceeding joy, that is a ſecond caſe wherein this Doctrine may be of comfort.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, this Doctrine may ſerve for
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:122181:134"/>comfort, in caſe of any inward accuſation of conſcience from the apprehenſion of thine own guiltineſſe, it may be thou judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thy ſelfe that thou art a damned undone Creature, why remember, that there is a Judgement to paſſe on thee beſides thy own miſtake and miſapprehenſion, Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Judgement ſhould be a comfort to thee againſt thine owne Inward accuſation, becauſe hee that is thy Jeſus, is thy Judge, hee is thy Advocate to pleade thy cauſe, when hee is thy Judge to judge thy cauſe; Suppoſe thy conſeience doth accuſe thee, and thou judgeſt thy ſelfe to Hell, yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort thy ſelfe with this, that thy Jeſus will afterwards come to judge thee.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, Chriſts coming againe to judge the World it is a Doctrine of comfort in caſe of Oppreſſion in Courts of Judicature. What though Might overcometh Right? any uſurping hand which uſeth ways of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and violence towards you, it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not. For Chriſts coming to judgement ſhall be of great comfort to you. <hi>Jerome</hi> ſaith, that Chriſt ſhall come to judge things that are not judged in the World, and CHRIST ſhall come to judge things that are judged amiſſe in the World, Chriſt ſhall judge all Oppreſſions and violence which is done by an uſurping hand, here is matter of comfort that Chriſt cometh to judge them all over againe, an excellent paſſage
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:122181:135"/>which <hi>Solomon</hi> hath, <hi>Eccle.</hi> 3.16, 17. <hi>And moreover I ſaw under the Sun the place of judgement, that wickedneſſe was there, and the place of righteouſneſſe, that iniquity was there.

            <p>I am now come to the Application of that poynt. The uſe is of caution, and cautions from this Doctrine of Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againe, there are Three.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, though the Doctrine of Chriſts coming againe be full of comfort, yet take this caution, that you are to looke on the Doctrine of Chriſts coming to judgement as a Doctrine to teach you duty, as well
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:122181:135"/>as to give you comfort, it is a great abuſe of your privileges when you make any Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell point to be an inlet of comfort, when you doe not make that very comfort to be a ſpurre to duties, and the Scripture putteth you upon this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.7. <hi>So that yee come behinde in no gift, waiting for the coming of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Now wee beſeech you Brethren, by the coming of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and by our gathering together unto him.</hi> Hee preſſeth them to duty on this Doctrine by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Ieſus Christ.</hi> Now to ſpeak diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to this caution, there are duties that the Doctrine of <hi>Chriſts</hi> coming is ſubſervient and ſerviceable unto.</p>

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:122181:136"/>for Chriſt will call you to an account of your hearing, <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.17. <hi>And the ſpirit and the Bride ſay come, and let him that heareth, ſay, come.</hi> Chriſt when hee comes hee will call you to an account for your hearing, thou that art an unfaithfull hearer, an unprofitable hearer, thou dareſt not ſay as the Spirit ſaith, Lord come, Lord come, but hee that groweth better by hearing, hee will ſay Lord come, Lord come, a notable Text, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.22. <hi>Hee alſo that had received two Talents, came and ſaid, Lord thou deliveredſt unto mee two Talents, behold, I have gayned two other Talents beſides them, His Lord ſaid unto him, well done, good and faithfull ſervant, thou haſt beene faithfull over a few things, I will make thee Ruler over many things, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.</hi> This is Chriſts Language as Divines interpret, that hee will come to judge the World, hee will call thee well done thou good and faithfull ſervant thou haſt improved thy gifts well, thou haſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved thy Talents well.</p>

The ſecond caution is this, take heed of peremptory concluſions about this darke and obſcure thing touching the Doctrine of Chriſts coming to judge the World.

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, take heede of determining the place from whence Chriſt ſhall come. The Papiſts they are bold this way: they hold you in hand that Chriſt ſhall come from the Eaſt.

            <p>Fourthly, the time that this judgement here is ſpoken of, it is limited by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet himſelfe, for compare this verſe with the ſecond verſe. <hi>I will alſo gather all Nations, and will bring them downe into the Valley of</hi> Jehoſhaphat, <hi>and will pleade with them there for my People, and for my heritage Iſrael, whom, they have ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered among the Nations, and parted my Land.</hi> The time is ſpoken of when God ſhall turne againe the captivity of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> then God ſhould judge the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> and thoſe Heathen Nations that aſſiſted them for to undoe the people of God; therefore it refers to ſome time after the captivity, and not to the generall and laſt coming of the Sonne of God, and thus much for taking off that Text from being a patronage of that fond conceit of Chriſts coming to judge the World in the Valley of <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> and the Scripture is farre from giving you the place where Chriſt ſhall come to judgement, either in the Valley of <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> or Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> but onely in the ayre. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.17. <hi>Then wee which are alive, and remaine, ſhall bee caught up together with them in the clouds, to meete the Lord in the Aire, and ſo ſhall wee ever be with the Lord.</hi> The Scripture doth make no mention of Chriſts coming upon the Earth at all.

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, take heed of bold attempts about the time of Chriſts judgement, there have beene them which have ſhewne abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of weakeneſſe in this. <hi>Gerrard</hi> doth confute the folly of ſuch men that doe gueſſe at the time when Chriſt ſhall come to judge the World. <hi>Auſtin</hi> doth make mention of ſome in his time, that held that Chriſt ſhould come to judge the World a thouſand years after his Death, but wee have ſeene their folly and ſhame, for there is more time expired then that.

               </gap>n the yeare, 1683. but beloved Chriſts coming to judge the World cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, for Chriſt would not gratifie his owne Apoſtles to tell them the time when his coming ſhould be, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. Hee would not tell them when the end of the world
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:122181:139"/>ſhould be, it ſhewes then that it is great pride of heart to paſſe peremptory at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts upon the period of time, Chriſt did not thinke it meete for to tell his Apoſtles of the time of his coming, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.1. <hi>But of the times and ſeaſons, Brethren, yee have no neede that I write unto you,</hi> nay Angells in Heaven. And Chriſt himſelfe as hee was meere Man could not tell the time, <hi>Mark.</hi> 13.32. <hi>But of that Day, and that Houre, knoweth no man, no not the Angells which are in Heaven, neither the Sonne, but the Father.

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:122181:140"/>peremptory in your determinations about the time of Chriſts coming, nor about the place where, for neither is revealed in Scripture; Chriſt did deny his Diſciples when they asked him where hee ſhould come. <hi>Luke</hi> 17.37. <hi>And they anſwered and ſaid, where Lord? And hee ſaid unto them, where the body is, thither will the Eagles be gathered together.</hi> Chriſt told them of the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and of the end of the World, then ſaid the Diſciples, but where Lord wilt thou come? Chriſt onely gives them this anſwer, that where the carcaſſe is, thither will the Eagles flee, that is, where Chriſt is, all the Elect ſhall bee gathered, as Birds of prey flock together after a carcaſſe to feed upon, ſo that Chriſt would neither tell the place where, nor the time when, and this ſhould be a check and a controule to mens curious pryings about that which the Scripture is ſilent in.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, take heed of bold and adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous attempts of the manner of Chriſts coming to judge the World, many are very peremptory about it, and there be ſtrange Bookes, at leaſt in their owne expreſſions, that they can deſcry the very manner of his coming, that CHRIST ſhall come from Heaven, and dwell a thouſand yeares upon the Earth, and the Dead ſhall riſe and live in the World, but theſe are ſuch things which the Scripture doth neere take notice

Before I ſhall come to give you my thoughts from the words touching Chriſts coming, as they pretend to Reigne a thouſand yeares upon the Earth; I ſhall ſhew you the riſe of this Opinion.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, from <hi>Euſebius</hi> and other, they give us this to be the riſe of this Opinion from <hi>Cyrenthus</hi> which had it, who lived in the time of <hi>John.</hi> This <hi>Cyrenthus</hi> who was a peſtilent Heretick in thoſe times, who held that Chriſt was borne by the Conjunction

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, I ſhall give you ſome reaſons from the Scripture, why Chriſt cannot come out of Heaven Bodily and in Perſon to Reigne a thouſand yeares upon the Earth.</p>
            <pb n="73" facs="tcp:122181:141"/>
            <p>Thirdly, I ſhall ſhew you ſome abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and incredulities that would follow if Chriſt ſhould come to Reigne a thouſand years upon the Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, for expreſſe Scriptures which are foure. The firſt Scripture is in <hi>Acts</hi> 3.21. <hi>Whom the Heaven muſt receive, untill the times of reſtitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets ſince the World began.</hi> There the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle telleth you directly, that the Heaven muſt receive and keepe <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> how long? till the reſtitution of all things. The Milleners hold that the reſtitution of all things may be at the time of Chriſts Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall Reigne, but I ſhall ſhew you that this reſtitution of all things cannot be till Chriſts judging the world. Firſt there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a totall abolition of ſinne in the World, at the thouſand yeares end there ſhall be a number of men, and wicked, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the thouſand yeares, all things cannot be reſtored, for ſinne bringeth the creature under a curſe, it is apparent that it cannot be till Chriſts laſt coming to judge the world, becauſe other Scriptures tell you that the time of reſtitution cannot be till our bodies be raiſed from the Dead, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. <hi>And not onely they, but our ſelves alſo which have the firſt fruites of the spirit, even wee our ſelves groane within our ſelves, waiting for the Adoption to wit, the redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:122181:142"/>of our bady;</hi> That is the creatures do as it were groane, being uſed by man as an inſtrument to Gods diſhonour, ſo that till the bodies of all the Elect be redeemed and glorified, till that time the creature lies under a curſe by reaſon of Mans ſinnes and Mans abuſe. And they themſelves hold that pleade for Chriſts perſonall reigne a thouſand yeares upon the Earth, though they doe hold that the Martyrs ſhall be raiſed at that time; but doe not hold that all the Elect ſhall be raiſed at that time, therefore the Apoſtle ſaith expreſly that the Heavens muſt keepe the perſon of Chriſt till the reſtitution of all things, till the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the Elect come to be raiſed from the Dead. Againe, it is apparent from the Context in <hi>Acts</hi> 3. That the reſtitution of all things can intend no other time then the time of Chriſts coming to Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, becauſe it is ſaid that the time here ſpoken of, it is when the <hi>Jewes</hi> were to be refreſhed from the Lords preſence, <hi>v.</hi> 19, 20, 21. <hi>Repent yee therefore, and be converted, that your ſinnes may be blotted out when the times of refreſhing ſhall come, from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord. And hee ſhall ſend Jeſus Chriſt, which before was preached unto you. Whom the Heaven must receive, untill the times of reſtitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:122181:142"/>ſince the World began.</hi> And they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be refreſhed by the Lords preſence till Chriſts coming to judgement.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, it was the time that God did ſolemnly declare pardon of ſinne for all the Elect, <hi>Repent, yee therefore and bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, that our Sinnes may hee blotted out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, it is ſaid, of which all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets do beare witneſſe, thoſe that doe plead for Chriſts perſonall Reigne a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeares upon the Earth, they cannot ſay that all the Prophets did ſpeake this, for <hi>Moſes, Daniel</hi> and others, nay none of the Prophets ſpeake of Chriſts Reigne a thouſand yeares upon the Earth, therefore this cannot have a reference to Chriſts Reigne for a thouſand yeares upon the Earth. A Second Scripture is in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.1. <hi>The Lord ſaid unto my Lord, ſit thou at my right Hand, untill I make thine Enemies thy Foote-ſtoole.</hi> That Scripture tells you; that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> who is aſcended into heaven and ſits at Gods right Hand there, that Chriſt ſhall ſit at Gods right Hand, how long? <hi>till hee hath made all his Enemies his Foote-ſtoole.</hi> The Apoſtle tells you that all Enemies to be made Chriſts Foot-ſtoole, cannot be till Chriſts coming at the laſt time. Will you marke that Scripture, that the Apoſtle tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth you directly, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.23, 24, 25, 26. <hi>But every man in his owne Order, Chriſt the firſt
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:122181:143"/>Fruits, afterwards they that are Chriſts at his coming. Then cometh the end, when hee ſhall have delivered up the Kingdome to God even the Father, when hee ſhall have put down all rule, and all authority, and all power. For hee muſt reigne, till hee hath put all Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies under his Feets. The laſt Enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed is Death.</hi> Here is the coming of Chriſt that hath reference to all, the Juſt and Unjuſt. Marke now, Chriſt therefore muſt reigne in Heaven till all enemies be under his Feete, now theſe thouſand yeares all Enemies are not under his Feete, why? becauſe death will be then, death is not to be deſtroyed then, for there will be thouſands of Men upon the Earth; but when the end comes hee muſt give up his Kingdome to his Father. What is more cleare then this, that the Heavens muſt keepe Chriſt till all things bee reſtored? and that cannot be till the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Againe, Chriſt muſt reigne ſo long till the end of the World. The third Scripture is in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.23.24. <hi>But every Man in his owne Order, Chriſt the firſt Fruits, afterwards they that are Chriſts at his coming. Then cometh the end, when hee ſhall have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered up the Kingdome to God even the Father, when hee ſhall have put down all rule, and all authority, and all power.</hi> This Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture telleth you that when Chriſt cometh
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:122181:143"/>out of Heaven, upon Chriſts coming, three things muſt be done.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, every man muſt riſe, <hi>verſ.</hi> 23. Now that cannot be at a thouſand years, becauſe they themſelves hold this, that there ſhall onely be a Reſurrection of the Martyrs, and here the Scripture ſaith, <hi>that every man ſhall riſe,</hi> which cannot be till the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, when Chriſt comes, then comes the end; the Apoſtle tells us of his coming and the end of the World; to note, that Chriſts coming and the end of the World ſhall be together.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, hee delivers his Kingdome up to his Father, whereas if Chriſt ſhould reigne a thouſand years here, it could not be ſaid to be the giving up of a Kingdome, but to the taking of a Kingdome into poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, hèe muſt reſigne all to God the Father. When the Scripture is ſo expreſſe it is a wonder that men can fancy ſuch fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſticall thoughts that Chriſt muſt come as an Earthly Monarch to reigne here a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years. A fourth Scripture is in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.28. <hi>So Christ was once offered to beare the ſinnes of many, and unto them that looke for him, ſhall hee appeare the ſecond time without ſinne, unto Salvation.</hi> From that Scripture I will argue againſt Chriſts coming to reigne upon the Earth for a thouſand yeares.</p>
            <pb n="78" facs="tcp:122181:144"/>
            <p>Firſt, it is expreſly in the Scripture that Chriſts coming there ſpoken of, it referres to the day of judgement in <hi>verſ.</hi> 27. <hi>And as it is appointed unto men once to dy, but after this the judgement.</hi> There Chriſts ſecond coming it doth referre to the day of Judgement. Now if the Scripture doth call that his ſecond coming, which is his coming to judgement? then Chriſt cannot come before that time as to reigne upon the Earth, for if hee ſhould come to reigne upon the Earth, then the Apoſtle muſt call that his third coming, there was but one coming which was from Heaven to the Wombe of the Virgin, and there is no other coming, but a ſecond coming, that is to judgement, that is his ſecond coming.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, it is ſaid, Chriſt ſhall come the ſecond time to our Salvation: it cannot be ſaid to our Salvation, if his coming were to reigne a thouſand yeares upon the earth, it were onely a worldly way, but Chriſts comming it muſt referre to the laſt and great coming, wherein the World ſhall be judged, and the Soules of the Elect ſhall be ſaved; Beloved, theſe Scriptures are very cleare unto mee. The reaſons are two; that Chriſt ſhall not come perſonally out of Heaven to reigne upon the Earth for a thouſand years. Firſt becauſe the Scripture doth manifeſt that when Chriſt comes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally out of Heaven, there are ſuch
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:122181:144"/>Concomitants of his coming that can be ref<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rred to no other time then his laſt coming to judge the World.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, when Chriſt is ſaid to come out of Heaven, the Scripture telleth you this Concomitant, that the Saints ſhall come along with him, <hi>Jude</hi> 14. And <hi>Enoch</hi> alſo the ſeventh from <hi>Adam,</hi> propheſied of theſe, ſaying, <hi>Behold, the Lord cometh, with ten thouſands of his Saints;</hi> So that when Chriſt comes from Heaven hee muſt come with his Saints with him, nay he muſt come with his Angels, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.7. <hi>And to you who are troubled, rest with us, when the Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from Heaven, with his mighty Angels.</hi> Theſe two Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures put together, Chriſt muſt come with his Saints and Angells. I but thoſe that fancy Chriſts coming a thouſand years, they cannot prove that Chriſt ſhall come with his Saints and Angells, for the Scripture that ſeemes to carry it that way, doth not ſpeak of Angells and Saints coming.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, it is ſaid when Chriſt comes from Heaven, that good and bad ſhall be gathered together, and all ſhall be judged by Jeſus Chriſt; now this cannot bee of Chriſts perſonall reigne on the Earth, this you have in 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Now wee beſeech you Brethren, by the coming of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and by our gathering together unto him.</hi> So that the coming of our Lord, and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:122181:145"/>our gathering together to be judged by Chriſt, they are both coupled together; becauſe when the Lords coming is, then is our gathering time, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.31.32. <hi>When the Sonne of Man ſhall come in his glory, and all the holy Angels with him, then ſhall hee ſit upon the Throne of his glory. And before him ſhall be gathered all Nations, and hee ſhall ſeperate them one from another, as a Shepheard divideth his Sheepe from the Goats.</hi> And in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. <hi>I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall judge the Quick and the Dead at his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, and his Kingdome.</hi> The Scripture telleth you that when Chriſt appeares to judge the World, hee ſhall have this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant of his coming, <hi>hee ſhall gather all together to judge both the Good and the Bad.</hi> Thoſe that pretend that Chriſt ſhall come to reigne a thouſand yeares upon the earth, they cannot prove that then all ſhall bee gathered together, they onely pleade for the Martyrs, and none elſe, therefore it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be referred to his coming to reigne a thouſand years.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, when Chriſt comes, then the end of the World is, a period is put to this World, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24. <hi>Then cometh the end, when hee ſhall have delivered up the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to God, even the Father, &amp;c.</hi> So when Chriſt comes, then comes the end; Now thoſe who hold for Chriſts perſonall reigne,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:122181:145"/>they hold that the end of the World ſhall not be till a thouſand yeares after, becauſe Chriſt muſt Reigne a thouſand yeares.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, the Reſurrection both of the juſt and unjuſt is a concomitant of Chriſts coming, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.23. <hi>But every man in his owne Order, Christ the firſt fruits, afterwards they that are Chriſts, at his coming.</hi> So that at Chriſts coming the generall Reſurrection of the juſt and unjuſt is to be.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, there is to be the Salvation of the Soules of all the Elect, that is a fifth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant of Chriſts coming, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.28. <hi>So Christ was once offered to beare the ſinnes of many, and unto them that looke for him, ſhall hee appeare the ſecond time without ſinne unto Salvation.</hi> This cannot bee referred to Chriſts Perſon coming upon the Earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee doth not come then to ſave the ſoules of all the Elect, that is the firſt reaſon why Chriſt cannot come to Reigne upon the Earth, that when the Scripture ſpeakes of Chriſt coming out of Heaven, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth annex five Concomitants with it, that it cannot be true of Chriſts coming upon the Earth, but to come to judge the World. A ſecond reaſon is this, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> cannot come to reigne upon the Earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if it ſhould be ſo, it would be worſe for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and it would be worſe for us then now it is, it would be worſe for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for to leave Heaven and come to the Earth,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:122181:146"/>for <hi>Chriſt</hi> to leave Saints and Angells and Heaven, for to live among the wicked and the good, for they themſelves confeſſe that wicked men ſhall live upon the Earth then. Then beſides they fancy Earthly delights, that the fruit of the Vineyard ſhall not fade, as now it doth, why they would leſſen <hi>Chriſts</hi> Glory, becauſe hee ſits this day at his Fathers right Hand, for to fancy this, that <hi>Christ</hi> muſt come to reigne upon the earth, it would be a great loſſe to all the Elect, for wee have the benefit of <hi>Christs</hi> everlaſting Interceſſion; And were <hi>Chriſt</hi> upon the Earth, wee ſhould loſe that benefit, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.4. <hi>For if hee were on the Earth, hee ſhould not be a Prieſt, ſeeing that there are Priests that offer gifts according to the Law.</hi> Therefore I doe wonder what they will doe that pretend great glory to <hi>Chriſt</hi> to reigne on the Earth, ſo that if hee were upon the Earth wee ſhould loſe the benefit of his Prieſt-hood; Therefore it would be a great wrong to us, to have <hi>Chriſt</hi> here on the Earth, becauſe the benefit of his Prieſtly Office would not be ſo availe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to us as it is in Heaven. Thus I have laid down Scripture and given you reaſons, why <hi>Chriſt</hi> cannot come, before his laſt coming.</p>
            <p>Now there are eight Incongruities, and Abſurdities that would follow in caſe you ſhould grant that CHRIST ſhould come
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:122181:146"/>to Reigne a thouſand yeares upon the Earth.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, by thoſe mens Principles, this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience will follow, that people may exactly know the punctuall time of <hi>Chriſts</hi> laſt coming to judge the World, for thoſe who hold <hi>Chriſts</hi> perſonall Reigne, they do as well hold the time as the thing, they doe as well maintaine when this Reigne ſhall begin; Therefore ſome have maintained that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould come to Reigne on the Earth in the yeare, 1650. One ſaith if it ſhall not be in the yeare 1650, it ſhall be in the yeare 1694. They that goe furtheſt give at that time, if ſo be they hold the thing, and maintaine the time when it ſhall begin, then of neceſſity, wee muſt know exactly when the day ſhall be that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall come to judge the World, for they grant it ſhal be imediately after the thouſand yeares; Now Beloved, that Opinion that carries this abſurdity to know the day of <hi>Christs</hi> coming to judge the World, which <hi>Christ</hi> ſaith, none in the World can tell, of that houre and day knoweth no man. <hi>Mark.</hi> 13.32. <hi>But of that day and houre knoweth no man, no not the Angells which are in Heaven, neither the Sonne, but the Father.</hi> Therefore it cannot poſſibly be that <hi>Chriſt</hi> muſt come on the Earth, therefore thoſe that live at leaſt to ſee <hi>Chriſt</hi> come from Heaven, they cannot tell to a Day when
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:122181:147"/>CHRIST ſhall come to judge the World.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> A ſecond Incongruity which will follow is this, if this ſhould be granted that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall Reigne on the Earth a thouſand years before his great and laſt coming to judge the World, then it will follow, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall almoſt be as long a time on the Earth as in Heaven, <hi>Chriſt</hi> dyed in the 33 yeare of his Age, and hath beene 1619 yeares in Heaven, and hee muſt be a thouſand yeares upon the Earth, that is very improbable. This incongruity will follow that it will be a great diſadvantage to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for <hi>Chriſt</hi> to come in perſon a thouſand yeares on the Earth, hee muſt leave his Father and leave his Heaven, and come and onely poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe Earth. Now <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe in the imediate enjoyment of his Father in Heaven, then hee can have here upon the Earth. Then it will be a loſſe to us, that wee ſhould loſe the benefit of his Prieſtly Office, but <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Sonne of righteouſneſſe being in Heaven, is more waileable to Believers, then if he were upon the Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, obſerve this, that if <hi>Christ</hi> ſhould come on the Earth for a thouſand yeares, then <hi>Chriſt</hi> would leave the Church after that thouſand yeares for a while, in a worſe condition, then hee found it, if <hi>Chriſt</hi> muſt come on the Earth, hee muſt
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:122181:147"/>leave his Church in a worſe condition then hee found it, and I draw it from that <hi>Text</hi> which they pretend to be the ſtrength of their Argument, <hi>Revel.</hi> 20.5.7.8. <hi>But the reſt of the Dead lived not againe untill the thouſand yeares were finiſhed. This is the firſt Reſurrection, And when the thouſand yeares are expired, Satan ſhall be looſed out of his Priſon. And ſhall goe out to deceive the Nations which are in the foure quarters of the Earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to Battell, the number of whom is as the Sand of the Sea.</hi> So that after the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeares, the Devill ſhall be let looſe againe, and there ſhall be an innumerable company of enemies, and they ſhall deſtroy multitudes of the godly; Therefore <hi>Chriſt</hi> would leave his Church in a worſe con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dition then hee found them, if this were true that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould reigne a thouſand years upon the Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, if <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould come to reigne a thouſand yeares upon the Earth, then this incongruity will follow, that there muſt be three perſonall comings of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> for his firſt coming was in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation. Second coming, to theſe thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeares. And his third coming muſt be to judge the World, that is, the laſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but the <hi>Scripture</hi> makes but two comings of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> Firſt, his coming from Heaven when hee was borne; his ſecond coming
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:122181:148"/>when hee comes to judge the World againe.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixtly, if <hi>Chriſt</hi> comes perſonally out of Heaven, this incongruity will follow, that either the Saints and Angells muſt come, or not come with <hi>Chriſt;</hi> if they muſt come with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> then it is a loſſe to them, for them to come to leave the imediate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, and come upon the Earth where wicked men ſhall be amongſt them: or if they muſt not come with <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> yet it is a loſe to them to remaine there, they ſhall loſe for a thouſand yeares the Body of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> if <hi>Chriſt</hi> be on the Earth, hee cannot be in Heaven the ſame time; Therefore it would be a loſſe to the Saints and Angells for them to be a thouſand yeares in Heaven without the company of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> not to have the perſon of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> with them.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> A ſeventh Incongruity will follow, that if <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall come to reigne upon the Earth, then <hi>Chriſts</hi> Kingdom muſt be a worldly &amp; terrene Kingdome, then it will be againſt the Word of God, he muſt be a viſible King to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and a viſible King to all the World beſides; this would follow then that <hi>Chriſts</hi> Kingdome muſt not be a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Kingdome, but a Terrene, a World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pompous Kingdome. <hi>Iohn</hi> 18.36. <hi>Jeſus anſwered, My Kingdome is not of this World, if my Kingdome were of this World,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:122181:148"/>then would my Servants fight, that I ſhould not be delivered to the Jewes, but now is my Kingdome not from hence.</hi> Luke 17.20. <hi>And when hee was demanded of the Phariſees when the Kingdome of God ſhould come, hee anſwered them and ſaid, The Kingdome of God cometh not with Obſervation.</hi> Would not all the World obſerve this, for <hi>Chriſt</hi> to come bodily from Heaven, and in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of a Monarch? Now <hi>Christs</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome doth not come with Obſervation. When the Diſciples looked after an Earthly Kingdome, <hi>No,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>my Kingdome is for to Rule and Reigne in your hearts, you ſhall never ſee mee for to be an outward pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous King in the World, for Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome it is a spirituall Kingdome.</hi>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Eightly, that if <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſhall come to take a Kingdome on the Earth for a thouſand yeares, then this Incongruity will follow, As if <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> had not a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and were not a King all this while hee is in Heaven; they apply, that, that place in <hi>Daniel</hi> and all thoſe Phraſes in the new Teſtament, that the Kingdome of the World is become the Kingdome of the Lord, they deny that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is a King in Heaven. When hee was in the Cratch and borne in the Stable, hee was a King at that very houre, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 2. The Apoſtle referres it to <hi>Chriſts</hi> Birth and <hi>Chriſts,</hi> Reſurrection. <hi>Chriſt</hi> when hee aroſe from the Dead hee
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:122181:149"/>was a King then, and the Goſpell under <hi>Chriſts</hi> time is called a Kingdome. It is remarkeable, in <hi>John</hi> 18.37. <hi>Pilate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid unto him, Art thou a King then? Jeſus anſwered, Thou ſayeſt that I am a King.</hi> Chriſt was a King, though hee would not be an Earthly King to deſtroy Earthly Governments, Therefore when the people in a tumult would have made him a King, yet hee would not, <hi>Zech.</hi> 9.9. <hi>Rejoyce greatly, O Daughter of Zion, ſhout O Daughter of Jeruſalem, behold thy King cometh unto thee, hee is juſt, and having Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, lowly, and riding upon an Aſſe, and upon a Colt, the fole of an Aſſe.</hi> Hee was a King, when hee was on that ſlow con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible creature, ſo that now to ſay <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall come to reigne as King, it is to intimate to the World, as if <hi>Chriſt</hi> were not a King at this day, and whereas hee is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords in heaven, therefore cannot come a thouſand yeares to reigne on the Earth.</p>
            <p>Now I will deale fairely to ſhew you what ſtrength, and give you the ſtrongeſt Scriptures that have moſt ſhew of reaſon, for the maintaining of this Opinion, and ſhall labour to take them off and cleare it to you. There are multitudes of quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that varieties of mens thoughs faſten upon to prove this poynt, yet thoſe they moſt ſtand to, I ſhall faſten upon, their
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:122181:149"/>chiefe Pillar is in <hi>Revel.</hi> 20.2, 4, 5, 6. <hi>And hee laid hold on the Dragon that old Serpent, which is the Divell and Satan, and bound him a thouſand yeares. And I ſaw thrones, and they ſate upon them, and judgement was given unto them, and I ſaw the Soules of them that were beheaded for the witneſſe of Jeſus, and for the Word of God, and which had not worſhipped the Beaſt, neither his Image, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had received his marke upon their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads, or in their hands, and they lived and reigned with Chriſt a thouſand yeares; But the reſt of the dead lived not againe untill the thouſand yeares were finiſhed. This is the firſt Reſurrection, Bleſſed, and holy is hee that hath part in the firſt Reſurrection, on ſuch the ſecond death hath no power, but they ſhall be Prieſts of God, and of Chriſt, and ſhall reigne with him a thouſand yeares.</hi> Now from this Text which is the chiefeſt in the Scripture they ſeeme to build theſe two things upon.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt ſhall live upon the Earth, and the Saints reigne with him for a thouſand yeares.</hi>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, <hi>Thoſe that were Martyrs by Antichrist ſhall riſe from the dead, and come upon the Earth, theſe thouſand yeares to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue with Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> This they build much upon, That <hi>Christ ſhall come to reigne a thouſand yeares upon the Earth,</hi> But I ſhall ſhew you that this cannot be the ſenſe of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:122181:150"/>it, and I ſhall give you Six Anſwers.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, that though the Scripture doth ſay that the Saints that were beheaded, that they ſhould live with Chriſt a thouſand yeares, yet the <hi>Text</hi> doth not ſay that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall come to reigne with them a thouſand yeares.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, though the Text ſaith, that they ſhould live and reigne with <hi>Chriſt</hi> a thouſand yeares, yet the Text doth not ſay that they ſhall reigne with him here upon the Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, that though it be ſaid that the Saints ſhall live, and reigne with <hi>Christ</hi> a thouſand yeares, yet living and reigning with <hi>Chriſt</hi> doth not neceſſarily imply to be in the ſame place where <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> is, for then you would pervert many Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: <hi>For loe,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I am with you to the end of the World;</hi> it doth not therefore follow, from that time hee will be upon the Earth to the end of the World, but <hi>Chriſt</hi> being with us, or wee with him, it doth not follow wee muſt be with him where hee is, but it is his Spirit. <hi>Romans</hi> 8.17. <hi>And if Children, then Heires of God, and joynt Heires with Chriſt: if ſo bee that wee ſuffer with him, that we may be alſo glorified together.</hi> The Text it doth not denote the ſamenes of place, and the onenes of ſcitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, I give this to take off that which is made of this Text.</p>
            <pb n="93" facs="tcp:122181:150"/>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, it is evident that this Scripture cannot be a Foundation to build on, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall come to reigne a thouſand yeares on the Earth, then it will not onely follow that men ſhall live ſo long, but ſhall reigne with <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſo long on the Earth. <hi>Methuſelah</hi> lived but nine hundred ſixty and nine yeares, and <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>the life of man is cut ſhort.</hi> The <hi>Text</hi> ſaith, they ſhall live and reigne with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in that ſence, taking living properly, and all the Phraſes properly, they muſt neceſſarily ſay that men ſhall live when that time comes, that men ſhall live a thouſand yeares to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Then, it cannot be the ſence of the Scripture, becauſe that cannot be the ſence of this Scripture which croſſeth the ſence of other Scriptures, to make this Scripture to affirme that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall reigne on the Earth a thouſand yeares, for other Scriptures tell you that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall ſtay in Heaven in perſon, till all men ſhall riſe from the Dead, every man ſhall riſe, then cometh the end. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.23, 24. <hi>But every man in his owne order, Chriſt the firſt fruits, afterwards they that are Chriſts, at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Then cometh the end, &amp;c.</hi> 2 Theſſ. 2.1. <hi>Now wee beſeech you Brethren, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and by our ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering together unto him.</hi> Then beſides it doth croſſe the Scripture to ſay that at <hi>Chriſts</hi> coming, onely ſome men ſhall ariſe,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:122181:151"/>but not all. <hi>Job</hi> 14.10, 11, 12. <hi>But man dieth and waſteth away, yea, man giveth up the ghoſt, and where is hee? As the waters faile from the Sea, and the Flood decayeth and dryeth up; So man lieth downe, and riſeth not, till the Heavens be no more, they ſhall not awake, nor be raiſed out of their ſleepe. Job</hi> telleth you expreſly, <hi>That the dead ſhall not be raiſed till the Heavens be no more,</hi> and that cannot be the thouſand yeares, for there will be a Earth, and a Heaven then; And in <hi>Peters</hi> phraſe, <hi>The Heavens ſhall melt away like a ſcrowle, &amp;c.</hi> Now to make a Reſurrection, before a Reſurrection, it is that which the Scripture doth no where mention, <hi>John</hi> 5.28, 29. <hi>Marvell not at this, for the houre is coming, in the which all that are in the Graves ſhall heare his Voyce. And ſhall come forth, they that have done good, unto the Reſurrection of life, and they that have done evill, unto the Reſurrection of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi> The judging of the juſt and unjuſt ſhall be the ſame houre, and upon Chriſts coming all men ſhall be judged, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. <hi>I charge thee therefore before God and the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who ſhall judge the quick and the dead, at his appearing, and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> So that Chriſts appearing, and Chriſts coming is a judging of the quick and the dead. Now Beloved, then to make this Scripture to ſay that Chriſt ſhall come on the Earth before his laſt coming, this is to
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:122181:151"/>croſſe other Scripture, then of neceſſity it cannot bee the ſcope of this, for there is no jarring between one phraſe of the Scripture and another.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, when the Scripture ſaith here, <hi>That they live and reigne with Chriſt a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeares,</hi> it may be as well, and they have as ſtrong a ground to plead, it is not ſpoken whether it be a reigning with CHRIST in Heaven or on Earth, ſo the phraſe neither carryeth it one way or another.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixthly, <hi>John</hi> doth not ſay, that he ſaw the bodies of men that were beheaded, and they reigned with Chriſt, but <hi>hee did in a Viſion ſee the Soules of them that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed,</hi> now to ſay that they muſt come to reigne on the Earth for a thouſand yeares, it were a great inconveniency to them; it is ſaid, <hi>I ſaw the Soules of them,</hi> the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeares cannot be applied to Chriſts perſonall Reigne, for either it muſt be apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him as hee is ſimply God, and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be applyed to him, for ſo <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> hath an eternall Kingdome, hee doth not reigne a thouſand yeares on Earth or in Heaven, but everlaſtingly, Kingdomes and States of this World have laſted a thouſand yeares, and to make Chriſts Kingdome to laſt no longer, it is to give Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome too narrow a confine. I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted with many Authors, and I finde the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:122181:152"/>concurrent of Interpreters generally runne this way, though ſome doe fancy that <hi>Text</hi> ſpeakes of the binding of the Divell for a thouſand yeares, and during this time, the Saints ſhould live and reigne with Chriſt for a thouſand yeares.

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:122181:154"/>did eſcape the rage and cruelty of the Ten Perſecutions, and did come to live in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantines</hi> days, and did all the while of the former Perſecutions, keepe themſelves from the Idolatry of the Heathens, and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of Antichriſt, they are ſaid to have a firſt Reſurrection: bleſſed are they that were raiſed up by Chriſt from their Sinnes, and from their Errours, Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Idolatry both of Antichriſt and the Heathens, that is, they were bleſſed.</p>
            <p>I but then it is ſaid, they live and reigne with Chriſt a thouſand yeares.</p>
            <p>Beloved, that phraſe, <hi>living and reigning with Chriſt,</hi> though ſome Interpreters refer it to Heaven, yet with <hi>Brightman</hi> and others, I concurre with theſe, and ſo <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, it doth denote thus much, that thoſe in Succeſſive Ages, who enjoyed Liberty in the Chriſtian Religion under <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, who lived to a thouſand yeares, that were delivered from former afflictions, and kept by Chriſts Power from the Idolatry of the Times, and from Antichriſt, they were ſaid to live with Chriſt a thouſand yeares, for they lived to him and depended on him, and were not plunged into the wickedneſſe of the Times; And thus with conſulting of many Authors I finde this to be the trueſt recount, in a few words, in taking of this
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:122181:154"/>
               <hi>Text</hi> from giving any foundation to Chriſts perſonall reigne for a thouſand yeares upon the Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond <hi>Scripture</hi> that they doe urge for Chriſts perſonall reigne upon the Earth for a thouſand yeares, and that is the 2 <hi>Peter</hi> 3.7, 10, 11, 12, 13. <hi>But the Heavens and the Earth which are now, by the ſame word are kept in ſtore, reſerved unto fire againſt the day of Judgement, and Perdition of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men. But the day of the Lord will come, as a Theife in the Night, in the which the Heavens ſhall paſſe away with a great noyſe, and the Elements ſhall melt with fervent heate, the Earth alſo and the Workes that are therein ſhall be burnt up.

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:122181:155"/>Scripture doth ſeeme to give warrant for a thouſand yeares reigne, this Scripture ſeemes to give warrant that it ſhall be on the Earth, they ſay that the righteous ſhall only have benefit of Chriſts perſonall reigne upon the Earth.</p>
            <p>To take off this. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, marke the ſcope and the context how this Scripture is brought in, and it will ſomething cleare the <hi>Text,</hi> it is brought in by ſome Epicurian Principles that ſome ſcoffers had taken in theſe times, <hi>ver.</hi> 3.4. <hi>Knowing this firſt, that there ſhall come in the laſt days ſcoffers, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after their owne lusts.

For ſince the Fathers fell aſleepe, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the Creation.</hi> Wee ſee no change in Providence, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore where is the promiſe of Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? They ſcoffed at Chriſt, that Chriſt was a contemptible man in this World, and that God ſhould judge the World by Chriſt, this is the Anſwer in the 7 <hi>verſ. But the Heavens and the Earth which are now, by the ſame word are kept in ſtore reſerved unto fire againſt the day of Judgement, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of ungodly Men. Peter</hi> ſpeakes direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the time of Chriſts coming (and they ſcoffed at it) was not the time of the thouſand yeares, but of the Time of the day of Judgement; Therefore this coming here that <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeakes of, it cannot be
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:122181:155"/>meant of a thouſand yeares before the day of Judgement.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the day of Perdition of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men, they ſay themſelves that Chriſt doth ſuffer the wicked of the World to live in the World, though not to rule as they have.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, obſerve, that it is ſaid here that before this new Earth is, that the World it ſhall be burnt with Fire, the Heavens ſhall paſſe away with a noyſe, &amp;c. So that now before a thouſand yeares there is no ſuch thing, as before the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the World cannot be as in the fore going Verſe. The burning of the World it is reſerved againſt that day, againſt the day of Judgement; Therefore the coming can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be referred to Chriſts Perſonall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Earth to reigne a thouſand yeares.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, it is ſaid here, that Chriſt ſhall come as a Thiefe, <hi>But the day of the Lord will come as a Thiefe in the Night, in the which tht Heavens ſhall paſſe away with a great noyſe, &amp;c.</hi> That Epithet it is referred to his coming to judge the World, to his laſt coming, and not to any other coming. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.2. <hi>For your ſelves know perfectly that the day of the Lord cometh as a Thiefe in the Night.</hi> But if Chriſt ſhould come to reigne upon the Earth, then hee cometh viſible, <hi>Mat.</hi> 43.44. <hi>But know this, that if

            <p>A Third Scripture, and that they deeme to have ſome ſtrength in too; In <hi>Daniel</hi> 2.44. <hi>And in the days of theſe Kings ſhall the God of Heaven ſet up a Kingdome, which ſhall never be deſtroyed, and the Kingdome ſhall not be left to other People, but it ſhall breake in pieces, and conſume all theſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and it ſhall ſtand for ever.</hi> And this <hi>Text, Aroher</hi> in his book referrs to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall reigne of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Now Beloved, to give you the ſcope of this <hi>Text,</hi> take theſe Anſwers.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, it is true, that a Kingdome is given by God to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and that Kingdom was given by God to <hi>Chriſt</hi> while hee was here upon the Earth in the forme of a ſervant, and this <hi>Luke</hi> tells you, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>verſ.</hi> 32, 33. <hi>Hee ſhall be great, and ſhall be called the Sonne of the higheſt, and the Lord God ſhall give unto him the Throne of his Father</hi> David, <hi>And hee ſhall reigne over the houſe of</hi> Jacob <hi>for ever, and of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome there ſhall be no end.</hi> So that <hi>Ieſus Christ</hi> had a Kingdome, and hee is now King of Kings, and Lord of Lords in Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, it is ſaid here, that this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome it was begun in the dayes of thoſe Kings. Now in whoſe dayes doth this
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:122181:157"/>Kingdome ſpeake of? It ſpeakes of thoſe that divided <hi>Alexanders</hi> Kingdome, who overcame the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> it was divided betweene <hi>Ptolomy</hi> Ring of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Silucas</hi> King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and the loynes of thoſe Kings ſhould ſucceede in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; In their time <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> did ſet up a Kingdome, for hee was borne King of the <hi>Jewes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, it is apparent that this cannot be referred to Chriſts Kingdome in this World for a thouſand yeares. Firſt, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid that it ſhould be a Kingdome for ever and ever, for a Kingdome for a thouſand yeares cannot be ſaid to be a Kingdome for ever and ever, but it is ſaid in Daniel, <hi>it ſhall be for ever and ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Fourth Scripture, is in <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.5. <hi>For this yee know, that no Whoremonger, nor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleane perſon, nor Covetous Man, who is an Idolater, hath any Inheritance in the Kingdome of Chriſt, and of God.</hi> And this <hi>Text Gerrard</hi> quotes and doth well reſolve it, they ſay there is not onely a Kingdome of God that is Heaven, but the Scripture doth make mention of a Kingdome of Chriſt, and a Kingdome of God, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they build on this of Chriſts Reigne, and of having of a Kingdome here upon Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, I anſwer, it is true, Chriſt hath a Kingdome, but hee ſaith expreſly, that <hi>his
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:122181:157"/>Kingdome is not of this World, John</hi> 18.36. <hi>Jeſus anſwered, my Kingdome is not of this World, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, though it be ſaid that there is here a Kingdome of Chriſt, yet it is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed to be upon the Earth, for a 1000 yeares.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, this Kingdome of Chriſt Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters referre it to the ſame with the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, and to be meant meerly exegettically: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, two expreſſions agree alike in one, many phraſes in Scripture which doe onely imply, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> now in Heaven, hee is King and Prieſt, his Kingly Office now in Heaven ruling all the Church of God by his Word and Power; Therefore thoſe Phraſes carry onely thus much, that Chriſt is King now in Heaven, the Adminiſtration of all affaires in the World at his diſpoſe, but when hee ſhall come to judge the World, then hee ſhall deliver up all to his Father.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> A fifth Text they have, is in <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.29. <hi>But I ſay unto you, I will not drinke henceforth of this fruit of the Vine, untill that day, when I drinke it new with you in my Fathers Kingdome.</hi> And this <hi>Alſted</hi> quotes, from thence they gather, it cannot be meant of Heaven, why? becauſe there is no eating and drinking there, here is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and come to them no more till hee would drinke with them
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:122181:158"/>Wine in his Fathers Kingdome, and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be unleſſe Chriſt doth come in perſon amongſt his people; Therefore Chriſt muſt have a Kingdome to eate and drinke with his people in this World. This they ſtand much upon.</p>
            <p>Take theſe cleare Anſwers, to theſe Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, if all this cannot be meant of a Kingdome in this World for a thouſand yeares, my reaſon is this, becauſe the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome which is Chriſts perſonall reigne, it ſhould be called Chriſts Kingdome, and not his Fathers Kingdome, it ſhould have been called <hi>my Kingdome,</hi> and not <hi>my Fathers Kingdome,</hi> that is one anſwer that Divines give.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, obſerve this, that this may referre to that time betweene Chriſts Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection and Aſcention, for after Chriſt did riſe from the dead, you know hee did continue forty dayes on the Earth, and the Scripture telleth you, in <hi>Luke</hi> 24.42. <hi>And they gave him a piece of broyled Fiſh, and of an Hony-combe, And hee tooke it, and did eate before them.</hi> So he may as well drinke as eate, but that to mee is ſomewhat uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, which is the true ſcope of this place; <hi>I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the Vine, untill that day when I drinke it new with you in my Fathers Kingdome:</hi>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:122181:158"/>hee was taking the Lords Supper, and was drinking the Cup of Wine, ſaith hee, <hi>I am going away and will drinke no more till wee meete in Heaven,</hi> not that there ſhould be Eating and Drinking in Heaven, but when you and I meete, wee ſhall have ſweet fellowſhip and communion together, as Eating and Drinking together; As Feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is a badge of Communion, and a badge of Love, ſo there ſhould be endeared love and endeared Communion with Chriſt in Heaven: <hi>you ſhall drink it new,</hi> not new Wine, nor eate new Bread, but after a new manner of Love and Communion, they ſhould expreſſe Love each to other, and have everlaſting Communion, one with another.</p>
            <p>They ſay likewiſe that there ſhall be no ſinne in the World, and that the Earth ſhall be reſtored to its primitive fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe as it were before the fall, but I ſhall not meddle with theſe. And thus according to my poore meaſure I have laboured to lay downe the grounds from Scripture, why Chriſt cannot come to reigne perſonally upon the Earth a thouſand yeares, and have vindicated thoſe Scriptures that ſeeme to patronize that Opinion.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>
               </label> Is it ſo, that the Scripture doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine of any coming of Chriſt out of Heaven till his laſt, and great coming to judge the World? O then labour to make
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:122181:159"/>it your worke to have <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> as King to reigne in your hearts by mortification, to rule in thy Heart by his Spirit, to Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie thy head-ſtrong luſts that are in thee.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Seeing there is no Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as King in this World, why then la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to have Chriſt to reigne in his Church by a well-ordered Diſcipline, that the Government of Chriſt may be eſtabliſhed in the places where you dwell.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, ſeeing there is no Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as King in this World, then doe not trouble your ſelves about Niceties, and Obſcurities about his coming upon the Earth, but labour to be fitted and prepared for his laſt and great coming.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, if Chriſt ſhould come to reigne upon the Earth, which the Scripture no ways ſpeakes of, then certainly the Saints of theſe times they doe make but a bad preparative for Chriſts reigne, men that doe impale Saint-ſhip, and monopolize Saint-ſhip unto themſelves, and ſay they are the people of God; The Church of Chriſt and the Saints of Chriſt, they make but a bad preparation for Chriſts coming, to live in ſenſuality as they doe, and comit ſuch wickedneſſes as they doe upon the Earth.</p>
            <p>This is but a bad preparation, and but poore encouragement to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:122181:159"/>come and reigne amongſt ſuch Saints as theſe are, which indeed are a ſcandall to Saints, a ſcandall to Religion, and would be a ſcandall to that thouſand yeares of Chriſt if hee ſhould come to reigne, but Chriſt will have better Saints then theſe are <hi>to reigne with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In treating of the Doctrine of Chriſts coming againe, the other Quere is this, how or after what manner ſhall this coming of Chriſt be? <hi>but I will come againe.</hi>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> ſhall come <hi>certainly.</hi> Chriſts coming is not to be numbred among Poeticall Fictions, or with the deluſion of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> but the certainty of Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againe, it is built on theſe three foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, it is built on the immutability of Gods decree, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.31. <hi>Becauſe he hath appoynted a day, in the which hee will judge

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the certainty doth ſtand upon the infallibility of Chriſts promiſes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.64. <hi>Jeſus ſaith unto him, Thou haſt ſaid, nevertheleſſe I ſay unto you, Hereafter ſhall yee ſee the Sonne of Man ſitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of Heaven,</hi> there is Chriſts promiſe, to which three of the Evangeliſts doe concurre.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly,the certainty of his coming, it is grounded upon the impartiality of his Juſtice, here every man hath not right, and in <hi>Solomons</hi> Phraſe, <hi>a juſt man periſheth in his uprightneſſe, and a wicked man prolong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his days in wickedneſſe,</hi> therefore to ſhew Gods impartiality, there muſt be a coming of the Sonne of Man to judge the World righteouſly. I means this, becauſe the Doctrine of Chriſts coming is impugned by Atheiſts, therefore you reade what <hi>Peter</hi> tells you, 2 <hi>Peter</hi> 3.3, 4. <hi>knowing this firſt, that there ſhall come in the laſt days ſcoffers, walking after their own luſts, And ſaying, where is the promiſe of his coming?

               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:122181:160"/>And wee reade of the men of <hi>Athens</hi> they queſtioned this, and would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this, of Chriſts coming to judge the World, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.32. <hi>And when they heard of the Reſurrection of the dead, ſome mocked, and others ſaid, wee will heare thee againe of this matter.</hi> Why of old time, in the times of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> or ſoone after, men did mock at this Doctrine, that the dead ſhould riſe, and Chriſt ſhould come to judge both the quick and the dead; Herein <hi>Gerrard</hi> reckons up abundance of Sects, as the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riani,</hi> the <hi>Dociani,</hi> and many others, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there is but one Scripture that carries a heſitancy in theſe Atheiſts to deny the coming of CHRIST to Judgement, <hi>John</hi> 8.15. <hi>Yee judge after the fleſh, I judge no Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Beloved, to this Text that they make uſe of, to ſhake this great Pillar of our hopes, the coming of Chriſt againe, take theſe two Anſwers, when Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I judge no man,</hi> that is, I judge no man with a raſh and heady judgement, as you judge men that are not of your Opinion, you judge things raſhly and inconſideratly, but I judge no man as you doe, ſo <hi>Auſtine,</hi> in his 36 Tract on <hi>John,</hi> gives it to be the ſence of the place, it doth not exclude Chriſt from judging the World at the laſt day, but not judging of men as the Phariſees, to wit, raſhly and inconſiderately.</p>
            <pb n="114" facs="tcp:122181:161"/>
            <p>Secondly, Chriſt doth here ſpeake, what was not the end of his coming in the fleſh, but the end of his coming was to judge all men, but <hi>I judge no man,</hi> that is, it was not the intent or the end of my firſt coming in the fleſh to judge men, but I referre it to the laſt coming to judge all men, <hi>John</hi> 1. When God ſent his Sonne to be borne of a Virgin, hee did not ſend him then to judge the World, hee reſerved that till his laſt coming, <hi>John</hi> 12.47, 48. <hi>And if any man heare my words, and believe not, I judge him not, for I come not to judge the World, but to ſave the World. Hee that rejecteth mee, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him, the word that I have spoken, the ſame ſhall judge him in the laſt day.</hi> The end of my firſt coming was not to judge, it was to be judged, and to be condemned by <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o die the curſed death. And that is the end of Chriſts firſt coming, <hi>he ſhall come certainly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Chriſt ſhall not onely come <hi>certainly,</hi> but hee ſhall come <hi>perſonally;</hi> It was the great miſtake of <hi>Origen,</hi> though hee holds for the coming of Chriſt againe, but hee pleades chiefly for the coming of Chriſt in Spirit, Therefore that Text that is ſaid, <hi>you ſhall ſee the Sonne of Man coming in the Clouds of Heaven,</hi> but <hi>Origen</hi> underſtands by the <hi>Clouds,</hi> to be the <hi>Saints,</hi> becauſe it is mentioned in Scripture, that the <hi>Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:122181:161"/>are called <hi>a cloud of witneſſes.</hi> Now this is to pervert the whole letter of this Bible, and turne all the Scripture into an Allegory and Metaphyſicall ſence; Now to the oppoſition of that, I lay down a ſecond property, that Chriſts coming ſhall be a perſonall coming out of Heaven, but the Scripture doth not ſpeake of Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Earth, but no further then the Aire, Chriſt in his Body ſhall come per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally out of Heaven. Now to prove this ſecond property, or ſecond manner or way of Chriſts coming, there are two Texts of Scripture to confirme it. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.17. <hi>Then wee which are alive, and remaine, ſhall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meete the Lord in the Aire, and ſo ſhall we ever be with the Lord,</hi> verſ. 16. <hi>For the Lord himſelfe ſhall deſcend with a ſhout from Heaven, &amp;c.</hi> If it had beene <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his Spirit, then it would have beene ſaid, The Lord by his ſpirit ſhall deſcend, But <hi>the Lord himſelfe ſhall deſcend from Heaven with a ſhout,</hi> it notes his perſonall coming out of Heaven, that whereas as <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> had a perſonall tranſlation, and as <hi>Chriſt</hi> had a viſible Elevation, hee was in the eyes of his Diſciples lifted up, ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall bodily deſcend and come out from heaven, the Lord himſelfe, &amp;c. Therefore it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the Lord by his Spirit, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.11. <hi>Which alſo ſaid, yee men of Galilee, why
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:122181:162"/>ſtand yee gazing up into Heaven? This ſame Jeſus which is taken up from you into Heaven, ſhall ſo come in like manner, as yee have ſeene him goe into Heaven.</hi> The ſame Jeſus that you ſaw Aſcend, ſhall deſcend, ſo that it cannot be Chriſt in his Spirit, but in his perſon. I onely mention this, to confute thoſe that follow the conceit of <hi>Origen,</hi> meerly to make <hi>Chriſts</hi> coming, to be but a ſpirituall coming, a coming in the hearts of Saints.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, his coming it ſhall be viſibly, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.11. <hi>This ſame Jeſus which is taken up from you into Heaven ſhall ſo come in like manner, as yee have ſeen him goe into heaven.</hi> That as <hi>Chriſts</hi> going up to Heaven bodily, it was viſible, ſo <hi>Chriſts</hi> coming out of Heaven it ſhall be viſible, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26 64. <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſhall yee ſee the Sonne of Man ſitting on the right hand of Power, and coming in the clouds.</hi> Indeed <hi>Chriſt</hi> did riſe inviſibly, for no man ſaw <hi>Chriſt</hi> riſe from the dead, but <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall deſcend viſibly, <hi>you ſhall ſee the Sonne of man, &amp;c.</hi> Mat. 24.30. <hi>And then ſhall appeare the ſigne of the Sonne of man in Heaven, and then ſhall all the Tribes of the Earth mourne, and they ſhall ſee the Sonne of man coming in the clouds of Heaven, with power and great glory.</hi> All men ſhall ſee the glory of <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> the wicked ſhall ſee him to their Amazement, and conſternation, and the godly ſhall ſee

               </label> Now a word of Application. Having ſhewed you how this Doctrine of Chriſts coming, it is a Doctrine of comfort, I ſhall onely finiſh this Poynt to ſhew you how this Doctrine of Chriſts coming, it is a Doctrine of terrour and of dread, and to whom. Now beloved, as every Doctrine doth carry hony with it, ſo ſaith a learned man, it is obſerveable that the word is not compared to Milke and Honey, but the word is compared to Salt, to have an effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy to make it ſmart. Beloved, you have heard the Hony of this Doctrine, what great comfort it will afford to godly men, but remember the word is Salt, and it is of a ſmart efficacy to terrifie and fret the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
            <p>Now the Doctrine of Chriſts coming, it is a terrible Doctrine in theſe foure things.</p>
            <p>To all wicked men Chriſts coming again it is a terrible Doctrine, becauſe firſt all the ſecretteſt ſinnes that ever a wicked man hath comitted in this World, they ſhall be made manifeſt to all. I confeſſe it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt among learned men, whether the ſinnes of good men as well as bad ſhall not be knowne, and there are ſtrong arguments that all ſhall be made knowne, but the Scripture is full in this, that at the day of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:122181:165"/>Judgement, that the ſinnes that a wicked man hath done in this World, they ſhall be publiſhed to all the Saints and Angells in Heaven, and all the men that were on Earth. It may be thou goeſt for an honeſt man amongſt thy Neighbours, yet thou loveſt thy Neighbours Wife, and goeſt in unto her; it may be thou art a Monſter among men, if thou haſt beene ſo, and if thou haſt deceived in thy Trade, why for all thy ſecreſie here, yet then all the World ſhall know thy deceite it is built upon that Text, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.17. <hi>For nothing is ſecret, that ſhall not be made manifeſt, neither any thing hid, that ſhall not be knowne,</hi> and come abroad. Here a thouſand things are hid that men do not know, here thou carrieſt it fairely, and ſquarely in the World, that men cannot ſay, <hi>black is thine Eye,</hi> but then they may ſay <hi>ſhame to thy Face,</hi> this is dread.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Chriſts coming it ſhall be dreadfull in regard of thy Separation from all the Elect of God. In <hi>Mat.</hi> 32.33. <hi>And before him ſhall be gathered all Nations, and hee ſhall ſeperate them one from another, as a Shephard divideth his Sheepe from the Goats.

            <p>I am now to make entrance into the fourth Fundamentall Doctrine in theſe words, <hi>And receive you unto my ſelfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe words containe in them, that great Fundamentall point touching the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of mans body, that not onely the Soule ſhall goe to Heaven, but alſo the bodies of godly men ſhall goe to Heaven, Chriſt ſhall come out of Heaven for this end, to receive the bodies as well as the Soules unto himſelfe. <hi>I will come againe and receive you unto my ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is ſome difference betweene a few Interpreters touching the ſence of theſe words, one carrieth it this way, that here the promiſe of <hi>Christs</hi> coming hee made it a little before hee was to die, ſaith <hi>Chriſt, Bee not troubled for I will come againe.</hi> Some referre that promiſe of <hi>coming againe,</hi> not to the laſt coming, but they referre it to that forty dayes that hee was upon the Earth, after his Reſurrection to the Aſcenſion; they referre that this promiſe was accompliſhed,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:122181:170"/>and <hi>then I will receive you unto my ſelfe,</hi> they make that to be nothing but this, that Chriſt after his Reſurrection did come to his Diſciples, and did eate a broyled Fiſh with them, and ſtayed forty dayes with them.

               </gap>ull, that they ſhould never have ſeene him more. Here are two or three reaſons from the Text, why that cannot be the ſence of the place, becauſe here was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe before that hee was going to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Houſe; Now that living upon the Earth forty dayes after his Reſurrection, cannot be his Fathers Houſe, but hee being in his Fathers Houſe, this cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be meant of <hi>Christs</hi> being coming againe at that time to them. Againe, that it is ſaid, where hee was to goe, hee was to goe to prepare a place for them, now if his meaning had beene that hee would come againe at forty dayes, it ſhould have beene an Earthly place that hee had prepared for them; But the current of Interpreters, ſeeing the weakeneſſe of that, gives many conſequent reaſons why it muſt neceſſarily be referred to <hi>Christs</hi> laſt coming, receiving of them everlaſting, when the body ſhall be raiſed, that here <hi>Chriſts</hi> coming againe
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:122181:170"/>it referres to no other coming but to his great and laſt coming to judge the World, and at that coming hee hath promiſed the Elect, that hee will receive them unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; As if hee ſhould have ſaid, Though I leave your bodies behind mee in the World for a ſeaſon, though they may be mangled and maſſacred by cruell Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and though you may be without my bodily preſence for a while, yet I doe not goe to Heaven to ſtay there for ever, but I promiſe you, I will come againe, and then I will take you into Heaven with mee. They would faine have had <hi>Chriſt</hi> to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them into Heaven, and faine would they have gone with him. The Diſciples when they heard <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpeake of going to his Fathers Houſe, why they were all on fire to goe with <hi>Chriſt</hi> into Heaven; O no ſaith <hi>Chriſt,</hi> I will come againe to judge the World, and then I will receive your very bodies into Heaven with mee, that as my body is in Heaven, ſo your bodies ſhall be there alſo with me.</p>

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:122181:171"/>a receiving them before <hi>Chriſts</hi> coming, and this is called a partiall and incompleat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, it is onely a receiving of the ſpirit and not of the body.</p>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, there are <hi>pregnant inſtances</hi> in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that after the godly die, their Soules are received into Heaven before CHRIST comes.</p>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, is, by altering the comma or ſtop in the Text, and reade it thus, <hi>I ſay unto thee this day, thou ſhalt be with mee in Paradiſe,</hi> that <hi>to day,</hi> they doe not referre it that the Thiefe ſhould be in Paradiſe. <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> doth give two Anſwers to this Evaſion.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, ſaith hee, it is not ſafe to alter a comma, or ſtop in Scripture, for ſo you may pervert the Scripture, and make it ſpeak what it never meant, if men at their pleaſure diſagreeing from all Copies, alter comma's in the tranſlation.</p>
            <p>Another Anſwer, that it appeares this cannot bee the ſenſe of it, to referre <hi>to day,</hi> to the time that Chriſt ſpake, and not to the time that the thiefe ſhould be in heaven, for ſaith <hi>Gerrard,</hi> marke the thiefes prayer,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:122181:172"/>In <hi>ver.</hi> 42. <hi>And be ſaid unto Jeſus, Lord, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member mee when thou comeſt into thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> Marke, there is the thiefes <hi>when,</hi> that <hi>when Chriſt ſhould come to Heaven,</hi> Chriſt ſhould remember him.

            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, <hi>this day,</hi> it was needleſſe for Chriſt to ſay <hi>to day,</hi> to tell him the time when hee ſpake, hee knew Chriſt ſpake to him then, but to ſpeake of the time when the thiefe ſhould be in Heaven, <hi>I ſay to thee</hi> this day <hi>thou ſhalt be with Mee in Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond Evaſion is this. It is true, Chriſt promiſed, <hi>thou ſhalt be with mee in Paradice,</hi> but Chriſt doth not ſay, <hi>thou ſhalt be with mee in Heaven,</hi> but <hi>with mee in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are three anſwers to give you to this Evaſion.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, that thoſe that will not by <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice</hi> underſtand <hi>Heaven</hi> by this Text, they then fall in with the Papiſts, either for <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,</hi> or a <hi>Limbus Patrum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, take this anſwer, that in other Scriptures when <hi>Paradice</hi> is mentioned, it
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:122181:173"/>is to be underſtood <hi>Heaven,</hi> and ſo the Apoſtle doth expound it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.2.4. <hi>I knew a man in Chriſt, above fourteene yeares agoe, whether in the body I cannot tell, or whether out of the body, I cannot tell, God knoweth, ſuch an one caught up to the third Heaven. How that hee was caught up into Paradice, and heard unſpeakeable words, which it is not lawfull for a man to utter.</hi> So that the Apoſtle by <hi>Paradice</hi> doth expound it to be <hi>Heaven,</hi> Revel. 2.7. <hi>Hee that hath an eare, let him heare what the Spirit ſaith unto the Churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eate of the Tree of Life, which is in the midſt of the Paradice of God.</hi> That is, hee ſhall enjoy <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, Chriſt</hi> in Heaven is the Tree of Life in the Paradice of God.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, it cannot be any Earthly Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, the Paradice <hi>Adam</hi> was in before his fall, for the Earthly Paradice was deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Flood, therefore of neceſſity when Chriſt tells the thiefe, <hi>To day ſhalt thou be with mee in Paradice,</hi> it muſt referre to the thiefes going to Heaven at that day with Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>A ſecond inſtance it is in <hi>Luke</hi> 16.22. <hi>And it came to paſſe that the Beggar dyed, and was carried by the Angells into</hi> Abrahams <hi>boſom; The rich man alſo dyed and was buried.</hi> This is another inſtance, that the ſoules of the Elect after death they go to Heaven.</p>
            <pb n="123" facs="tcp:122181:173"/>
            <p>There are two Evaſions made upon this Text.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, they ſay, that this Text it is a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and not an Hiſtoricall Narration.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, though ſome men doe ſay it is a Parable, yet many ſay it is a Hiſtory. <hi>Jerome</hi> and many following him doth give many Arguments to prove, that it was a Hiſtory, and not a Parable. And <hi>Tertullian</hi> is confident that this is an exact Hiſtory of what was really done; And <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> doth quote <hi>Tertullian,</hi> ſaith hee, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> is ſo confident that this is a Hiſtory, that hee undertakes for to tell this, to tell you whom were the men, ſaith hee, the Rich man was <hi>Herod,</hi> and the Beggar was <hi>Iohn the Baptiſt.</hi> But ſuppoſe it be a Parable and not a Hiſtory, yet Parables doe carry the reſemblance of truth, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables take their Foundations from truth, that there are ſome men in Hell, and ſome men in Heaven, that in Hell there is tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and in Heaven there is joy, that as the beggar went to Heaven after death, ſo ſhall all the godly, and as the rich man went to Hell, ſo ſhall all the wicked.</p>
            <p>The other Evaſion is this, it is ſaid that this Beggar is ſaid to be carried into <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> boſome, I anſwer, Firſt, it is more then probable that <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome is Heaven; Now <hi>Abraham</hi> being in Heaven, why all his children are in Heaven
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:122181:174"/>as children in a Fathers boſome, he being the Father of the faithfull, that is the anſwer that <hi>Gerrard</hi> gives.</p>
            <p>Againe, it is ſaid, that they are carried by Angells into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome muſt be in Heaven: now certainly the good Angells carry a good ſoule into Heaven, and the wicked Angels carry a damned ſoule into hell, and thus you have two Inſtances, that imediatly after death the ſoules of the Elect goe to Heaven.</p>
            <p>A third Inſtance is in <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.31, 32. <hi>But as touching the Reſurrection of the dead, have you not read that which was ſpoken unto you by God, ſaying, I am the God of</hi> Abraham, <hi>and the God of</hi> Iſaac, <hi>and the God of</hi> Jacob? <hi>God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</hi> Argue from that Inſtance that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> were living at that time, though not in their bodies, but they were at that time living, if you marke the reaſon, the reaſon of that Text was not to prove a Reſurrection of the body onely, which the <hi>Saduces</hi> deny, but alſo to prove the imortality of the Soule. The <hi>Saduces</hi> deny Spirits and Angells too. <hi>Acts</hi> 23.8. <hi>For the</hi> Saduces <hi>ſay that there is no Reſurrection, neither Angell nor Spirit, but the Phariſees confeſſe both.</hi> Chriſt doth prove that there ſhall be a Reſurrection of the body, and hee likewiſe proves that
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:122181:174"/>the ſoule doth not die when the body dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. Indeed there is a quotation that I have read of a learned man that doth make uſe of this Inſtance, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.8. <hi>Then</hi> Abraham <hi>gave up the Ghoſt, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of yeares, and was ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered to his people.</hi> Abraham was not ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered to his Fathers, nor to be gathered in the grave where his fore-fathers were, how can this be true that the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Abraham was gathered unto his Fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thers?</hi> yet hee was not gathered to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in God, therefore ſay Divines, it muſt be in his Soule, that <hi>Abraham</hi> went to Heaven as his godly fore-fathers went, that is the meaning of that phraſe, to be bound up in the bundle of Life, to goe to Heaven as their fore-fathers did. And thus much for particular Inſtances.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond way to prove that the ſoules of the Elect men goe to Heaven imediately after death; It is by generall Expreſſions in Scripture. Two generall paſſages, one is In <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.23. <hi>To the generall Aſſembly, and Church of the firſt borne, which are written in Heaven, and to God the judge of all, and to the Spirits of juſt men made perfect:</hi> thence I argue, that the Apoſtle makes mention, and proves that there were the Spirits of juſt men made perfect; Now if their ſoules did periſh with their bodies, then the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſhould ſay, that their ſpirits are
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:122181:175"/>annihilated with the body, but it is <hi>the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect;</hi> the Scripture takes notice in generall expreſſions that juſt men have their ſoules made perfect. And then in <hi>Eccle.</hi> 12.7. <hi>Then ſhall the duſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to the Earth, as it was, and the Spirit ſhall returne to God who gave it.</hi> Marke, here are two things ſpoken of.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, here is the end of godly men, <hi>the body ſhall goe to the dust, and the ſoule to God,</hi> the time when it ſhall be is, when that man goeth to his long home, when the keepers of the Houſe ſhall tremble, that is the Hands, and Armes; and the ſtrong men ſhall bow themſelves, that is the Feete and Thighs; and the Grinders ſhall ceaſe, that is the Teeth; and they that looke out at the windowes ſhall be darkened, that is, the Eyes; when nature decayes and the body periſheth by Diſeaſes and dyes, <hi>then ſhall the body goe to the duſt, and the ſpirit to God that gave it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, I ſhall prove it to you from expreſſe paſſages in the Scripture that doe confirme this, that the ſoules of the Elect after death before Chriſts coming are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into heaven, for this I ſhall give, foure or five expreſſe Scriptures.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The firſt is in <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.40. <hi>And this is the will of him that ſent mee, that every one which ſeeth the Sonne, and believeth on him, may have Everlaſting life, and I will raiſe him up at the laſt day.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="127" facs="tcp:122181:175"/>
            <p>Here are two diſtinct promiſes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, a promiſe of everlaſting Life. </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, a promiſe of raiſing up at the laſt day.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, a promiſe of everlaſting Life is made diſtinct from the other. Divines ſay that before the raiſing up at the laſt day there is an everlaſting Life, that his ſoule ſhall live before the laſt day, and his body ſhall be raiſed up at the laſt day.</p>
            <p>Another Text is in <hi>Luke</hi> 16.9. <hi>And I ſay unto you, make to your ſelves friends of the Mammon of unrighteouſneſſe, that when yee faile, they may receive you into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting habitations. Kemnitius,</hi> makes great uſe of this Text to prove what I am now arguing to you, that imediately after death, the ſoule of an Elect man is received into Heaven. Marke, <hi>make you friends of the Mammon of unrighteouſneſſe,</hi> that is, your wealth, called ſo either becauſe it is unrighteouſly gotten, or unrighteouſly kept; uſe your wealth well, <hi>that when you die you may be received into everlaſting habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</hi> It is queſtionable whether it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to Angells, or to the poore which ſhall pray for us that wee may be received into Heaven, but ſaith <hi>Kemnitius,</hi> uſe your wealth well, that you may be received into everlaſting habitations, upon your failing, upon your dying the Lord receives
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:122181:176"/>the Elect into everlaſting habitations. This <hi>Kemnitius</hi> doth build on, that the ſoule doth goe to Heaven imediately after Death.</p>
            <p>A third Scripture is in <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.23. <hi>For I am in a ſtraite betwixt two, having a deſire to depart, and to be with Chriſt, which is far better.</hi> So that the Apoſtle doth only make theſe two concluſions, a departing out of the World, out of this Life, and a deſire to be with <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> hee mentions no place for a good ſoule to goe to, hee mentions no <hi>Purgatory,</hi> nor <hi>Limbus Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo likewiſe a fourth Text you have in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.8.9. <hi>Therefore wee are alwayes confident, knowing that whilſt we are at home in the body, wee are abſent from the Lord.</hi> Wee are confident I ſay, and willing rather to be abſent from the body, and to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with the Lord; Wherefore we labour, that whether preſent or abſent, wee may be accepted of him. Marke. That the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle doth onely make theſe two conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, to be <hi>abſent from the body,</hi> and to be <hi>preſent with the Lord,</hi> ſo that the ſoule is preſent with the Lord, whilſt abſent from the body.</p>
            <p>Then againe, that Prayer of <hi>Stephen</hi> proves it likewiſe; in <hi>Acts</hi> 7.59. <hi>And they ſtoned</hi> Stephen, <hi>calling upon God, and ſaying, Lord Jeſus receive my ſpirit.</hi> It had beene
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:122181:176"/>uncomfortable for him to have thought that hee ſhould have beene ſtoned for <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and it muſt have beene above 1600 yeares before Chriſt ſhould have received his ſoule, but hee prayed, <hi>Lord Ieſus Chriſt receive my Soule,</hi> which hee would not have done if hee had not believed that his ſoule would have beene received by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> imediately after death.</p>
            <p>And thus I leave thoſe Scriptures to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme you in this, that the ſoule doth not ſleepe in the body, but at the parture from the body it doth imediately goe to Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, I prove it to you by ſhewing thoſe groſſe abſurdities and inconveniencies that will ariſe, in caſe it ſhould be denyed that God doth not receive the ſoule of any Elect man, till hee doth come to judge the World.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, it will follow that the godly will be in a worſe condition after they are dead, then they were in when they were alive, for when they were alive, to live is Chriſt, Chriſt dwelt in their hearts by Faith; Now if the ſoule doth ſleepe with the body, and periſh with the body, then Chriſt doth not live in them, Chriſt doth not dwell there by Faith, ſo that this would be uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable that a believer after death ſhould be in a worſe condition, then during this Life, for here he lives in Chriſt by Faith.</p>
            <pb n="130" facs="tcp:122181:177"/>
            <p>Secondly, then it will follow, that God the Father would be more cruell to his people, then hee would have other men be to their ſervants which have done their worke. Marke that Text, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.13. <hi>Thou ſhalt not defraud thy Neighbour, neither rob him, the wages of him that is hired ſhall not abide with thee all night, untill the morning.</hi> That the Maſter was not to keepe the hire of the Labourer long from him, that the Maſter ſhould not keep the ſervants wages long from him; Now will the great God keepe you who are his ſervants that have ſerved him here in this World, and have done him faithfull ſervice, and will hee keepe any reward from you till his laſt coming? No, but when you have ended your Life, and done your worke, you receive your wages, when your work is done, you have your reward.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, obſerve this, if this ſhould be true that the Soules of the Elect men doe not goe to Heaven after death, then it will follow that the ſoules of wicked men doe not goe to Hell after death, and how re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant this is to the Scripture you well know, when the Scripture ſaith in the Epiſtle of <hi>Jude,</hi> That <hi>the men of</hi> Sodome <hi>and</hi> Gomorrha <hi>ſuffered the vengeance of eternall fire,</hi> And of Judas, <hi>Acts</hi> 25. <hi>That hee may take part of this Miniſtery, and Apoſtle-ſhip, from which</hi> Judas <hi>by tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:122181:177"/>fell, that hee might goe to his owne place.</hi> I could give you multitude of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances where the wicked are in Hell, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.19 20. <hi>By which alſo hee went, and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto the Spirits in priſon.</hi> Which <hi>ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times were diſobedient, when once the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering of God waited in the dayes of</hi> Noah, <hi>while the Arke was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight ſoules were ſaved by water.</hi> That is <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> by his Spirit in the Miniſtery of <hi>Noah</hi> did preach to the old World, who were diſobedient to that Preacher of righteouſneſſe, who is now in Heaven; To ſay that a godly man doth not goe to Heaven imediately after death, it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that a wicked man doth not go to Hell imediately after death.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, it would follow that there ſhould be onely Angels in Heaven and no Saints, whereas the Scripture ſaith expreſly that <hi>Chriſt ſhall come from Heaven with his Saints;</hi> And wee reade in Scripture, that there are <hi>the Spirits of juſt men made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> as well as <hi>the innumerable company of Angells.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, this would follow that it would be a great diſcomfort to a godly man on his death-bed, if hee ſhould be ſo many hundred yeares before Chriſt would bring him to Heaven, what comfort ſhall a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man have to die, when hee ſhall ſay it ſhall be ſo many hundred yeares before my
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:122181:178"/>body and my ſoule ſhall be thought of by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> it would be a very uncomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Doctrine for a man to thinke that I ſhall die like a beaſt, that my ſoule after death ſhall not be taken up into Heaven. And thus I have proved that imediatly after the godly die, their Soules are received into Heaven: I have proved it by pregnant In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in the Scripture, by generall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions in the Scripture, and by thoſe expreſſe paſſages in Scripture, and have given you thoſe abſurdities, that will ariſe in caſe it ſhould be denyed.</p>
            <p>A word now from what hath beene ſpoken. If it be ſo that Chriſt doth receive thee, O thou Believer, receive thee to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe before his totall and compleate recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I would then give you this uſe for to comfort you.</p>

There are two Queres in the Doctrinall part of this poynt touching the end of Chriſts coming, which is to raiſe the bodies of the Elect, and to receive them to himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Two things in this. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, why <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> muſt raiſe the bodies of the Elect, and receive them to himſelfe, as well as the ſoules.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, when Chriſt doth receive the body to himſelfe, then what endowments doth the body receive, as now it hath not?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, why muſt Chriſt receive the body to himſelfe, as well as the ſoule?</p>
            <p>There are foure Reaſons.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, becauſe of the Reſurrection of his own body, Chriſts own body is raiſed from the dead, and received up into Heaven, and therefore the bodies of the Elect muſt be there alſo; where Chriſt is, there muſt his members be. Chriſt the head is raiſed from the dead, and received up into glory. The Apoſtle doth ground this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.12. <hi>Now if Chriſt be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that hee roſe from the dead, &amp;c.</hi> As if hee ſhould have ſaid, Chriſt being riſen from the dead, doth argue that our bodies muſt
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:122181:179"/>riſe from the Grave, though they be dead there. In 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14. <hi>And God hath both raiſed up the Lord, and will alſo raiſe up us by his own power.</hi> 1 Theſſ. 4.14. <hi>For if wee believe that Ieſus dyed, and roſe againe, even ſo them alſo which ſleepe in Ieſus, will God bring with him.</hi> So that becauſe <hi>Jeſus Chriſts</hi> body is raiſed from the dead, and received up into Heaven, therefore our bodies muſt be raiſed up and received into glory with him.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the bodies of the Elect muſt be raiſed, why? becauſe of the Inhabitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Spirit, the Spirit doth ſanctifie the bodies of the Elect, as well as the ſoules, <hi>the very God of peace ſanctifie you throughont, and I pray God that your Soule, Spirit and Body, be kept blameleſſe unto the coming of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.18, 19, 20. <hi>Flee Fornication, every ſinne that a man doth is without the body, but hee that comitteth Fornication ſinneth againſt his owne body. What, know yee not that your body is the Temple of the holy Ghost which is in you, which yee have of God, and yee are not your owne? For yee are bought with a price; Therefore glorifie God in your body, and in your Spirit, which are Gods.</hi> Now the Spirit of God having a gracious worke in the body as well as the ſoule; Therefore the body muſt be raiſed up from the dead as well as the ſoule, and this the Scripture
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:122181:180"/>makes an Argument of, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11. <hi>But if the Spirit of him that raiſed up Jeſus from the dead, dwell in you, hee that raiſed up Chriſt from the dead, ſhall alſo quicken your mortall bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.</hi> So that ſpirit that raiſed up Chriſt from the dead, if that Spirit dwelleth in you, the graces of the ſpirit, why that Spirit ſhall quicken your mortall bodies; Therefore the bodies of the Elect ſhall be raiſed from the dead and received into glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with the ſoule.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, becauſe the body hath a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and co-operation with the ſoule in all gracious working, becauſe if that the body ſhall be partner with the ſoule, being received unto <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> becauſe the Body doth co-operate with the Soule, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. <hi>For if yee live after the fleſh yee ſhall die, but if yee through the Spirit doe mortifie the deeds of the fleſh, yee ſhall live.</hi> Now being that the godly doe mortifie the deeds of the body, and do expoſe their bodies to tortures and torments for Jeſus Chriſt, now becauſe the bodies of the Elect, doe co-operate with the ſoule in good, therefore the body ſhall be co-partner with the ſoule in good alſo.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, it proceeds from that neere Union which is in a Believer, and Jeſus Chriſt, Chriſt is the head, and Believers are the members; now the members muſt be
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:122181:180"/>raiſed and received up to Jeſus Chriſt to make his body a perfect body. Thus much for the Reaſons why that Jeſus Chriſt at his ſecond coming he ſhall raiſe and receive the bodies of the Elect to himſelfe, as well as the ſoules.</p>
            <p>The ſecond quere is this, I but what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit is it to the body, what endowments ſhall the body receive by this, when Chriſt comes?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, in generall I ſhall ſay this to you, that the body ſhall receive more glorious endowments then ever it could be capable of to receive, and enjoy here in this world, it may be thy Body is endowed with a comely feature, yet when Chriſt comes to receive thy Body, it ſhall be endowed bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then now it is. <hi>Chriſostome</hi> ſaith, Take Wooll, and let this Wooll be dyed into a Scarlet, or purple colour, dyed in graine, yet the Wooll is the ſame Wooll as it was before, when it was white, but yet there is a more goodly luſtre put upon it. Thy body ſhall be the ſame body, but thy body ſhall have more illuſtrious endowments, then now it hath.</p>
            <p>And thus much onely in the generall, Now to come to particulars. I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve this Queſtion in theſe ſix Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
            <p>There are ſix glorious endowments that the body ſhall receive from Jeſus Chriſt,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:122181:181"/>at his ſecond coming, when hee receives the body to himſelfe.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, from being a naturall body as it is now, it ſhall be made by Chriſt a ſpirituall body, that is the firſt endowment, thou ſhalt caſt off thy old Apparell of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſh and blood, and ſhalt be cloathed with robes of glory, it is no contradiction to ſay a ſpirituall body, becauſe the Apoſtle uſeth the expreſſion, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.44. <hi>It is ſowne a naturall body, it is raiſed a ſpirituall body, There is a naturall body, and there is a ſpirituall body.</hi> The meaning is, the body as it lives here, is a naturall body, reeding na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall refreſhments. I but ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>it ſhall be raiſed a spirituall body,</hi> it ſhall have no more neede of naturall refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which the naturall body requireth, when it is a ſpirituall body it ſtands in no more neede of meate, no more neede of drinke and of ſleepe, and other naturall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments, it ſhall be raiſed a ſpirituall body. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.30. <hi>For in the Reſurrection they neither Marry, nor are given in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, but are as the Angells of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>od in Heaven,</hi> The Angels have no need of relations, and ſtand in no need of helps, when they ſhall be as the Angels of God. <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.15, 16. <hi>Therefore are they before the Throne of God, and ſerve him day and night in his Temple, and he that ſitteth on the Throne ſhall dwell among them, They ſhall hunger no more, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:122181:181"/>thirſt any more, nither ſhall the Sunne light on them, nor any heate.</hi> Therefore O believing ſoul, behold thy happines of ſoule and body in glory; they ſhall be no more ſtanding in neede of naturall refreſhments then ſpirits doe, when the Scripture ſaith that your bodies ſhould be received by Chriſt. The Platonick Philoſophers under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, becauſe the body ſhall be turned into a Spirit, into a Ghoſt, or into winde or aire, but that is not the reaſon of it, it ſhall be of the ſame ſubſtance as it is upon the Earth, but it ſhall be refined.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the bodies of the Elect when Chriſt receiveth them to himſelfe, when being vile bodies, they ſhall be made formed and beautifull, it may be thou haſt ſome deformity, but Chriſt ſhall refine that body, and new varniſh and make it beautifull, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.21. <hi>Who ſhall change our vile body, that it may be faſhioned like his glorious body, according to the working whereby hee is able even to ſubdue all things unto himſelfe.</hi> The Body of Chriſt is a beautifull body, neither ſpot nor wrinckle, nor any ſuch thing in it, why thy body ſhall be like Chriſts glorious Body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.43. <hi>It is ſowne in diſhonour, it is raiſed in glory, it is ſowne in weakeneſſe, it is raiſed in power.</hi> Here thy body it is a vile body, <hi>Eliphaz</hi> calls the body <hi>a houſe of clay,</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> calls it <hi>a houſe of Earth;</hi> It is the Opinion of

               <hi>Gerrard,</hi> and hee gives ſtrong reaſons for it, that if there be any defects upon the body in this World, that if any of the members of the Body be wanting, it ſhall be reſtored to thee at the Reſurrection, and there are theſe reaſons to be given for it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, becauſe our bodies are promiſed to be like Chriſts Body, why now Chriſts Body hath no redundant and defective member, defect it is but the product of ſinne and the reſult of ſinne, therefore our bodies beeing ſaid to be like Chriſts Body, there ſhall be no defect in it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, ſome members are neceſſarily required to make up the Elect in Heaven; ſuppoſe an Elect man ſhould be borne blind, or loſe his Eyes by caſualty, now if this man ſhould not have his Eyes hee could never ſee Chriſt in Heaven, wee ſhall ſee with theſe very Eyes the Body of Chriſt, though thy body be a monſtrous Body, yet Chriſt ſhall receive thy body to make it better.</p>

            <p>Now before I come to the Application, there are two Objections which lye in the way.

            <p>That I might take off this, The Scripture which they urge is this, you talke of the Body being raiſed by Chriſt, how can this be when the Apoſtle ſaith expreſly, the body is made of fleſh and blood, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.50. <hi>Now this I ſay Brethren, that fleſh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdome of God, neither doth corruption, inherit incorruption.</hi> Therefore if fleſh and blood cannot come to Gods Kingdome, how then can the Body come there? this is the Opinion of the <hi>Photinians.</hi>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Second Text which they urge againſt the body being glorified, and ſay it is but a fancy, <hi>Job</hi> 14.7, 8, 9, 10. <hi>For there is hope of a Tree, if it be cut downe, that it will sprout againe, and that the tender branch thereof will not ceaſe. Though the roote thereof wax old in the Earth, and the ſtock thereof die in the ground, yet through the ſent of water it will bud, and bring forth Boughs like a Plant: But man dieth and waſteth away, yea, man giveth up the ghoſt, and where is hee?</hi> A <hi>Tree,</hi>

            <p>To this, take this cleare Anſwer, That when <hi>Job</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>though a Tree dyes it lives againe, but if man dyes hee lives not, Job</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands it by <hi>living againe</hi> in this World, ſo there is more hope of a Tree then of a Man.</p>
            <p>I but you will aske mee, How doe you prove this for to be <hi>Jobs</hi> intent?</p>
            <p>I prove it to you from <hi>Jobs</hi> words in the 12. verſ. <hi>So man lieth downe, and riſeth not, till the Heavens be no more, they ſhall not awake nor be raiſed out of their ſleepe.</hi> So that here <hi>Job</hi> ſpeakes of a raiſing when <hi>the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens ſhall be no more,</hi> when the World ſhall be burnt with fire, then man ſhall be awakned. And in the 14. verſ. <hi>If a man die ſhall hee live againe? All the dayes of my appointed time will I waite till my change come. Job</hi> ſpeakes in this Chapter of the change of the body, and of the raiſing of the body. <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Auſtine</hi> ſay well, that there is no Doctrine of Religion is more repugnant to ſenſe and reaſon.</p>
            <p>There is this reaſon that may ſeeme to be againſt the raiſing of the body, How it is poſſible that the bodies of men can be raiſed when that they are ſo confounded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as they are in the Earth.</p>
